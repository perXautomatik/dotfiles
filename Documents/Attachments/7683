<p>Dear Mr President, The UK Parliament has passed the European Union (Withdrawal) (No. 2) Act 2019. Its provisions now require Her Majesty’s Government to seek an extension of the period provided under Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union, including as applied by Article 106a of the Euratom Treaty, currently due to expire at 11.00pm GMT on 31 October 2019, until 11.00pm GMT on 31 January 2020. I am writing therefore to inform the European Council that the United Kingdom is seeking a further extension to the period provided under Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union, including as applied by Article 106a of the Euratom Treaty. The United Kingdom proposes that this period should end at 11.00pm GMT on 31 January 2020. If the parties are able to ratify before this date, the Government proposes that the period should be terminated early. Yours sincerely, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland</p>

Making Counseling Appointments
As we continue to evolve and adjust to our current situation, please look for more information as to how students
can best reach their counselor. We may need to share an electronic appointment request. Please encourage
students to check emails regularly for future information and guidance.
Students New to Wadsworth High School
We look forward to welcoming students and families new to Wadsworth High School this fall. If your student
enrolled over the summer, please plan to join the counselors at one of the New Student & Parent Scheduling
meetings scheduled for Friday, August 7th at 10:00a.m. in the Media Center or Monday, August 10th at
6:00p.m. Please bring a copy of your student’s transcript and current schedule. Students from Sacred Heart do not
need to attend. Students with an IEP, please schedule an appointment with your school counselor. We must have a
copy of your current IEP in order to create a schedule. We most likely cannot schedule during the group
orientation meetings. If your student has a 504 plan, we will also need a copy.
Schedule Adjustments
Reminder- all students had until late May to change their current class requests. At this point, only corrections
will be made. If a student does not have a study hall, they may drop a class after the 10th day of school. Level
changes also will not occur until after day 10. During the second week of class, students wanting to change levels
need to 1) Discuss the level change with their current instructor. 2)Request a change form from the Guidance
Office for teacher and parent signature. Grades may transfer with the student per teacher discretion. All change
requests for second semester must occur by interim of the second grading period.
College Planning- Seniors
An in-depth, virtual college planning lesson will be shared with all seniors and posted for remote learners in early
fall. Students will access Naviance to utilize college planning information, understand the application process and
required steps, as well as locate scholarship resources. Please ask your student to access Naviance and share these
resources with you. Counselors will hold virtual individual conferences upon request to review credits, discuss
post-secondary plans and answer questions in late September/ early October. **Seniors may begin requesting
