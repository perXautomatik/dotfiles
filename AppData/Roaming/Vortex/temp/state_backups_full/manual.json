            "description": "Tired of a static, predictable game?\n<br />\n<br />This mod changes that\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff0000][size=5][b][u]Description\n<br />\n<br />[/u][/b]If updating from 1.3 or 1.4 To a newer version, it requires a clean install (remove mod, load game, save game, exit, check new version. play, save game) Failure to do this will break the mod, as a new spawn system is in place[b][u]\n<br />\n<br />[/u][/b][/size][/color][color=rgb(255,255,255)][size=3]This mod adds a number of encounters, based on level as well as when you obtain certain items, for example taking a high tech weapon or rare item may cause some Stalkers to come after you. New enemies will seek you out and try to kill you and can find you no matter where you are and will find ways into your settlement, after all they didn't make it this far without some skills.\n<br />Battles will become unpredictable and you will always be watching over your shoulder for the next Maniac who wants to steal what you have as well as random interactions where they are robbing or trying to attack a settlement.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Simply play as normal and eventually someone will come looking for you, be warned, this mod wasn't made to be easy and enemies spawn at high levels even from a new game. Sometimes you will have to just run, but they wont give up their pursuit once they see your loot.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />The aim is to be a realistic mod and may sometimes appear unbalanced as a result \n<br />\n<br />When resting, enemies that are currently looking for you may catch up and appear when you wake. \n<br />\n<br />[/size][/color][color=#ff0000][size=5][b][u]New enemy types:\n<br />[/u][/b][/size][/color][color=rgb(255,255,255)][size=3][b]\n<br />[/b][u]Bandits [/u]\n<br />The most common type of enemy, they want your stuff. They use anything from Melee to high level rifles and will chase you down. \n<br />They have good gear and powerful weapons, and know how to handle a firefight\n<br />\n<br />[u]Cannibals[/u] \n<br />Looking to cut your flesh away and eat it, they are recognised by their poor appearance of rags, may carry guns or melee. The weakest of the new enemies they are easy to shoot down but have been known to easily sneak up on people. \n<br />\n<br />[u][b]Maniacs[/b][/u]\n<br />[/size][/color]\n<br />[size=3]Men and women driven insane by radiation, they are crazy blood seeking murderers. They prefer melee weapons such as rippers and sledgehammers, but don't be fooled. Due to their insane nature they have a 30% increased running speed and attack speed and wont give up easily\n<br />\n<br />[/size][u][b][size=3]Addicts\n<br />\n<br />[/size][/b][/u][size=3]Looking for their next fix, they are fuelled with buffout, med X and any other number of drugs. They have over double the health pool of all the other classes and feel no pain, relentlessly attacking their enemy to get those precious chems[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b][u][b][u][size=3]Trackers[/size][/u][/b][/u][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]Not as[/size] [size=3]combat savy as the rest of the classes, but they have perception of 10. Meaning they are almost impossible to hide from. They are tasked by their Bandit group to find new targets and hunt them down, they have also been known to call in reinforcements if they cant take down their target\n<br />\n<br />[b][u]Stalkers[/u][/b]\n<br />\n<br />Carrying advanced tech, these enemies are rare but use stealth tech to hide and ambush you, if you take high tech items (such as an advanced alien weapon) these enemies will seek you out. They are rare, but cannot be targeted in vats, are almost invisible and use high tech grenades and laser weapons\n<br />\n<br />[b][u]Hunter Killers[/u][/b]\n<br />\n<br />Highly dangerous cyborgs, they were once escaped synths but something went wrong. They have upgraded themselves and they only spawn at high player levels. Very tough, high tech weapons and don't give up. Will hunt you down and destroy everything in their path to kill you\n<br />\n<br />[b][u]Titans[/u][/b]\n<br />Power armour using bandits, they are the best of the best, even stronger than the boss classes of the human bandits. Very tough, but still use raider weapons. And they are still human, spawn at mid to high level players\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[/size][size=5][u][b]Bosses[/b][/u][/size]\n<br />[size=3]Each class also has a few bosses that may spawn at higher levels, however these are extremely rare. Just be warned, they have survived a long time in the wastes and have acquired some high level tech[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff0000][size=5][u][b]How to play this mod\n<br />[/b][/u][/size][/color][size=3]This mod doesn't require a new game, but some of the enemy spawns work when the player levels up (level 3 to level 80)\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />For example: Attacking a raider dungeon may trigger a few bandits coming after you to get revenge, they will spawn far away and then may take anything from a few minutes to and hour to find you on the map\n<br />\n<br /> Be careful when resting as they may ambush you when you wake up\n<br />\n<br />[/size][color=#ff0000][size=5][u][b]Installation\n<br />[/b][/u][/size][/color][size=3]Simple file, place in Data Folder\n<br />[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[u][b][color=#00ff00][size=5]Permissions\n<br />[/size][/color][/b][/u]\n<br />Do not upload this anywhere else and do not edit and upload unless I give permission, if you are just translating it that's allowed just let me know \n<br />\n<br />[b][u][color=#ff0000][size=5]Known bugs[/size][/color][/u][/b]\n<br />\n<br />1. Do not use the 'kill all' command in the command console, this will break the mod, even If you cant see any enemies around.\n<br />\n<br />2. Sometimes killing an enemy, loading a earlier save and playing again will cause them to never spawn again, unknown why3\n<br />\n<br />3. IMPORTANT, I suggest you turn off sleeping in survival mode and do no rest, as enemies will tend to fast travel to you, this is not intended",

I hope it makes your gameplay experience better too. In general, it will make the game harder, but it will also train you to become better. [/b][b]Gameplay won't feel as complete without some of the mods recommended above ([b]best you have them all though for the ultimate immersive gameplay possible). [/b][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][b]\n<br />[img]http://i63.tinypic.com/ab3vck.jpg[/img][/b]\n<br />\n<br />What i basically wanted to establish in the mod, is for me (the player) to not have to think each time how the game actors would respond to my actions. For example in real life you know that when you stand 30 meters away from someone at line of sight he will see you. In the game that's not the case. He may, or he may not, you must make guesses. \n<br />\n<br />IRL if you (were to) break into someone's house at night will you start lighting candles in order to see more clearly and navigate through the house? Will you start moving faster just to get on with your daily (/nightly) business? The game doesn't care very much about that. Same goes for absolute darkness - if you are spotted. \n<br />\n<br />My goal was to not have to think how the game would act in a specific scenario. For example when infiltrating a raider base / camp. I would just have to act how i would in real life, ie. be absolutely prepared and ready not to make any mistakes. Which means any noise, running, line of sight with enemy will make you spotted. You will have to be [/b][b][size=3]extra[/size] [/b][b]careful. If you are spotted, you will no longer become \"unspotted\" after a few seconds of searching by the enemies! The enemy AI will be [size=3][u]relentless[/u] [/size]especially on this. The enemy doesn't have schizophrenia. He knows what he saw, he knows what he heard. He saw you! It's a matter of life and death. The NPC's life depends on finding you and killing you! He won't stop searching for you for a long time and in longer distances! [A[b]bout 5 times more searching time actually and x1.5 greater distance radius (careful not to up this too much, as it can cause bugs). Game separates searching time in \"look\" time, as just looking or being suspicious, and in time after you have already been spotted (in which case searching time is much more than \"look\" time.] [/b]The slightest thing can trigger the ai! So do you understand? You don't have to think how the enemies / game ai would react, you act based on intuition (in other words by real life experience to put it semi-loosely). You simply act (more like) the way you would in real life. \n<br />[b]\n<br />All these factors and much more (see technical section) can be adjusted by properly setting various formula coefficients that affect the gameplay. Bethesda set them loosely, because the average gamer doesn't notice and thus may not care about that sort of thing. This mod makes these coefficients more harsh by performing the delicate and intricate process of [u]optimization[/u]. \n<br />\n<br />As i said, the goal is realism. I believe the mod makes the game more realistic (by making it harder). \n<br />[/b]But make sure you also have (at the very least) a greater damage mod in order for all of this to make sense. Even if you the perfect ai mod, what does it matter if the enemies can't kill you? No tactical skills and no challenge and no reward. \n<br />[/b][b]\n<br />The process of optimizing these settings is ongoing (but currently on a stable and sufficient for me level). These tweaks may be improved in a future version, or even more game settings may be considered and come into play. They are, by no means, perfect. I just believe they are better than Vanilla. \n<br />[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[img]http://i67.tinypic.com/1585dz8.jpg[/img]\n<br />\n<br />[b]Of course Bethesda for Fallout is always the first to give thanks for creating the game! [/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b]Various fora, especially on Nexus &amp; Bethesda helped me a great deal in assembling this information. [/b]\n<br />[b]Particularly the websites below: [/b]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][b][size=2][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/74355/?]Skyrim Realistic AI Detection[/url] - Olivier Doorenbos's mod for Skyrim helped me greatly in assembling a lot of information about the game settings and get on with this process faster.

Better Weapon Mod Descriptions has merged with [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/5028/]Better Armor Mod Descriptions[/url] into this mod: Better Mod Descriptions, combining both mods into a single one. No more having to use both BAMD and BWMD just to get your numbers fix for Legendary Modifications, it&#39;s all in one place now.\r<br />Update v2.1 (27.05.2016): Reaching even the Farthest Harbor, the newest DLC&#39;s armor and weapon mods are now included in this update.\r<br />\r<br />And a bonus for NMM users: There is now a All-In-One NMM file which allows you to install any and all mods from a single download. Because I can. Note that just because you can choose every single compatible file doesn&#39;t necessarily mean they&#39;re all inter-compatible.\r<br />\r<br />A further note: There&#39;s a known bug in Fallout 4 which can cause the game to crash when attempting to load a save file which is missing 4+ plugins. If this happens, you can circumvent this issue by forcibly loading the save file via console commands, use [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/838/]F4SGE[/url] to clear your save file of any references to missing plugins or simply rename new plugins to their old names until the bug doesn&#39;t trigger.\r<br />\r<br />Compatibility versions only modify the descriptions of modifications that are actually changed by the to-be compatible mod. You need the main BMD file as well as the compatible version. Load Order should be: Main BMD File followed by Other Mod followed by Other Mod Compatible BMD File.[/b]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]Additionally, a Google Spreadsheet with all vanilla base & Automatron weapons and their respective modifications as well as \r<br />legendary effects can be found under the articles tab.[/b]\r<br />\r<br />Tired of Better Recoil, Exceptional Damage or Poor Range? Want to know how much a Dense Chestpiece actually reduces explosive damage? Try some actual numbers on your mods&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Better Mod Descriptions strives to give you some actual information on what each armor and weapon mod does by changing the descriptions of each and every modification.\r<br />\r<br />It leaves all values at their vanilla setting and merely lists them all - including some which weren&#39;t actually noted in the old descriptions but still present. Using BMD does not make your weapon mods stronger or weaker in any way.\r<br />\r<br />So, what does Better Weapon Mod Descriptions do exactly? Here&#39;s an example, using the Hunting Rifle .50 Receiver:\r<br />\r<br />[u]Old Description:[/u] Exceptional Damage. Changes ammo type to .50 Caliber. Improved rate of fire.\r<br />&#34;Exceptional&#34; they said. &#34;Improved&#34; they said. Join the vaguey, they said.\r<br />\r<br />[u]Better Mod Descriptions:[/u] +75% Damage. Uses .50 Rounds. +25% Fire Rate. -25% Reload Time.\r<br />+75% Damage? Don&#39;t mind if I do&#33; +25% Fire Rate? Yes please&#33; Wait, .50 Receivers decrease the Reload Time too? Who knew&#33;\r<br />\r<br />These kinds of changes have been applied to all armor and weapon mods (including unique items/effects and legendary modifiers) in the game, revealing actual numbers and sometimes even previously unknown modifiers for those who like their descriptions actually, well, descriptive.\r<br />\r<br />Prefer it in video format?

hats\n<br />ArmorBodyPartHead - helmets\n<br />ArmorBodyPartEyes - glasses/goggles\n<br />ClothingDogmeat + playerCannotEquip - Dogmeat only equipable\n<br />ArmorBodyPartChest - chest armor overlays\n<br />dn_PowerArmor_Helmet\n<br />dn_PowerArmor_LeftArm\n<br />dn_PowerArmor_LeftLeg\n<br />dn_PowerArmor_RightArm\n<br />dn_PowerArmor_RightLeg\n<br />dn_Powerarmor_Torso\n<br />\n<br />And that is it.  As you can see we're missing the same left/right arm/leg breakdown for armor overlay pieces (leather, combat armor, etc).  We're also missing an standard keywords on clothing, armor suits, and the like.  The is also no Super Mutant keyword.\n<br />\n<br />This resource solves that problem by adding keywords to tag armor/cosmetics so that mod authors can properly classify their items.  See tutorial article attached to this page for more specifics.\n<br />\n<br />If you are creating a mod that adds new wearable items, use this resource and one of the keywords and follow the instructions outlined in this article, then your new items will be prepared for dynamic naming automatically with no need for compatibility patches.  The resource includes all vanilla items properly tagged and prepared for dynamic naming.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#a4c2f4][size=4]Instructions for Mod Authors[/size][/color]\n<br />--------------------\n<br />Make ArmorKeywords.esm a master on your .esp and link it as a required file when you upload your mod to Nexus.\n<br />To override an item, start with the resource item and copy as override into your .esp.  All pieces to run dynamic naming are already set as detailed below.\n<br />To create a new item, start with a resource item that is close then copy as a new item into your .esp.  All pieces to run dynamic naming should carryover.  Adjust community keywords as needed to properly tag and classify your item.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#a4c2f4][size=4]Details[/size][/color]\n<br />---------------------\n<br />Dynamic naming works off the INNR records in FO4Edit (latest version calls these Instance Naming Rule).  These rules run as If...Then statements looking for keywords on the object and applying a piece of the item's name if a matching rule is found.\n<br />\n<br />However, by default many armor items don't run dynamic naming rules because they didn't have any upgrades available in vanilla.  In order to force them to run dynamic naming rules the INRD of the item records must be set to the EditorID of the rule to run for that item.  Additionally, the OBTS must have a minimal definition as follows (if the item already has OBTE defined, do not change it; below is only for items where OBTE is undefined):\n<br />\n<br />OBTE - Count = 1\n<br />OBTS Parts A Count = 0\n<br />OBTS Parts B Count = 0\n<br />OBTS Unknown (first instance) = 00 00 00 00 FF FF 01\n<br />OBTS Unknown (second instance) = 00 00\n<br />\n<br />With INRD and OBTE set, it is then up to the author of sorting mods or mods that modify naming rules how to utilize the keywords the item is tagged with.  In this way, sorting mods do not need to modify armor records to accomplish sorting and mods that add new armor/clothing can be sorted automatically as long both modders use these community keywords.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#a4c2f4][size=4]Mods[/size][/color]\n<br />----------------------\n<br />This community resource was initially envisioned and realized by Valdacil and Gambit77 in order to make Valdacil's Item Sorting (VIS) compatible with Armorsmith.  Once we got started, we realized this would be a great framework to universalize the armor modding community and make life easier for both armor modders and sorting modders.\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/3877][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/6091-1-1458806456.png[/img][/url]\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/10654/?][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/6091-0-1458806457.png[/img][/url]\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/2228][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/2228-0-1458422585.png[/img][/url]\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/10737?][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/10737-0-1465681897.jpg[/img]\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/33383][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/33383/33383-1531962186-1069291878.png[/img][/url]\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/11840?][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/11840-7-1460311902.png[/img]\n<br />[/url][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/12040?][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/12040-0-1460827319.png[/img][/url][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/12041?][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/12041-0-1460827879.png[/img][/url]\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/2451][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/2451-0-1448341068.png[/img][/url]\n<br />\n<br />[size=5]Contributors\n<br />Plugin work by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/users/2695294]Gambit77[/url], [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/users/23176]Valdacil[/url], &amp; [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/users/30287520]Thirdstorm[/url].  Part of AWKCR color swap framework contributed by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/users/37855955]AndrewCX[/url].\n<br />Armorsmith Workbench by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/users/2695294]Gambit77[/url], [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/users/9388143]Aldebaran90[/url], &amp; [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/users/2117112]Stndmunki[/url].\n<br />Armorsmith Workbench Mini variants by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/users/2546964]FadingSignal[/url].\n<br />Weaponsmith Workbench by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/users/2695294]Gambit77[/url].\n<br />Weaponsmith Workbench Mini variant by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/users/2546964]FadingSignal[/url].\n<br />Ammunition Workbench by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/users/6194747]KKtheBeast[/url], [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/users/2695294]Gambit77[/url], [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/users/3626807]BenEphla[/url], [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/users/15964729]KingTobbe[/url], [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/users/4791731]Wanamingo[/url], &amp; [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/users/35654095]LoneRaptor[/url].\n<br />Ammunition Workbench F4NV variant by [url=https://darien.artstation.com/projects/PZvN3]Circles[/url], [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/users/45460092]Leldorado[/url], &amp; [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/users/6194747]KKtheBeast[/url].\n<br />Explosive Workbenches by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/users/981385]Chucksteel[/url].\n<br />AWKCR compatibility patches by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/users/935126]DrDanzel[/url].\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[color=#a4c2f4][size=4]Compatibility patch installer[/size][/color]\n<br />----------------------\n<br />An NMM installer for multiple compatibility patches is available as an optional download in the files section.

The old Targeting HUD mod is now the Targeting HUD Platform mod. It unlocks 3 new mod slots that allow you to independently apply Friend, Foe, and Corpse Recognition mods.\n<br />\n<br />The categories of what mods are available for a specific item correspond with which of these 8 categories are present on that item.\n<br />\n<br />Five, adds new color swap mods, gloves, Helmets/Hats With Hair, Under Helmet Flight Cap &amp; BOS/Sack Hoods, Nudifying Rings, Invisible Therm Optics Combat Armor, and a wide variety of wearable weapons.  Outfits are crafted at the Armorsmith bench, wearable weapons are crafted at the Weaponsmith bench.\n<br />\n<br />Six, all clothing items are moddable now and are also rename-able.\n<br />\n<br />Seven, I made this mod compatible with [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/33449]VIS-G Legendary Modifications[/url].\n<br />\n<br />Eight, for the master armorsmith/scientists out there I've implemented a new craftable set of armor called Therm Optics Combat Armor. Using stealth \n<br />technology it is now possible to create cloaked combat armor pieces. Also the chestpiece can be modded with a therm optics booster that will extend the cloaking field around the user when standing still and sneaking. There is a known bug with this: These new Therm Optic armor pieces will not automatically unequip previously worn armor, you have to do that manually. This was was the only way to do invisible armor with properly functioning mods.\n<br />\n<br />Nine, this mod is now fully compatible with [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/33383]VIS-G Item Sorting[/url].  Also to make the inventory sorting experience even better I also recommend [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/10654/?]DEF_UI by Neanka and Valdacil[/url].  It makes a bunch of UI improvements and does cool stuff like replacing sorting tags with icons.  From here on out [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/6091/?]Armor and Weapon Keywords Community Resource (AWKCR)[/url] is a required file for AE, as the ArmorKeywords.esm contains the framework to make AE compatible with VIS-G without compatibility patches.\n<br />\n<br />Ten, I optimized the slot usage for all vanilla clothing to use the minimum amount of slots necessary for things to work properly.  This was done to free up slots for use by modders for clothing and accessories.  This was set up to use the Slot Usage Standard. Revision(3/25/2016)\n<br />30 - Hair on top of head/most hats\n<br />31 - long hair/flight cap linings/under helmet/hat hoods\n<br />32 - FaceGenHead (used if your worried about the face clipping through a full face mask)\n<br />33 - Full outfits - Shoes/Boots\n<br />34 - Left Hand\n<br />35 - Right Hand\n<br />36 - Arm Add-on (Bracelets), Melee weapon on back\n<br />37 - Torso Layered Add-on (Jackets)\n<br />38 - Separate Tops (for vanilla outfits that need a second slot to show all armatures-Cage/Spike/ChildofAtom)\n<br />39 - Leg Add-on (Gun on Hip/Tights/Stockings/Vanilla outfits that need a third slot to show all armatures-ChildofAtom)\n<br />40 - Separate Pants/Shorts/Skirts\n<br />41 - Torso armor\n<br />42 - Left Arm armor\n<br />43 - Right Arm armor\n<br />44 - Left Leg armor\n<br />45 - Right Leg armor\n<br />46 - Masks that cover face/headbands/(hats/helmets/hoods meant to show all hair)\n<br />47 - Eyes (Glasses/Eyepatchs)\n<br />48 - Beard (surgical mask/lower face masks)\n<br />49 - Mouth (surgical mask/lower face masks)(toothpick/cigarette/joint/cigar/blunt/lip rings)\n<br />50 - Necklace/Scarfs\n<br />51 - Ring\n<br />54 - Backpacks/ Capes/ Cloaks\n<br />55 - Satchels\n<br />56 - Shoulder Harnesses/Bandoliers\n<br />57 - Plate Carrier/Cargo Pack Vests(front and back torso)/ Belts(utility belts/gunbelts/sword belts)/ Capes/Cloaks(alternate backup slot)\n<br />58 - Body Jewelry (piercings)/ Gun on back\n<br />61 - Off-Hand Accessories (Sword Sheath/Decorative Gun/SOS if they need a Dong slot), Exoskeletons, non-eyewear head flashlights\n<br />\n<br />Eleven, All apparel can now be worn by Nick Valentine.\n<br />\n<br />Twelve, Strong or any other future super mutant followers/settlers can wear all hats/helmets, gas masks, bandanas/masks, and glasses.\n<br />\n<br />Thirteen, Changes to vanilla Hazmat Suit and Damaged Hazmat Suit: now the armor index mod slot allows to to switch between vanilla opaque lens and transparent lens with a flight cap. I also added a craftable Hazmat Suit (w/Hair) with a transparent lens.  Changes to vanilla Hooded Cleanroom Suit: now the armor index mod slot allows to to switch between vanilla opaque lens and transparent lens.\n<br />\n<br />Fourteen, Added crafting recipes for all vanilla/DLC apparel/armor/power armor. (Weaponsmith update adds crafting recipes for all vanilla/dlc weapons and ammo.

Or at the very least, his \"Ghoul Edition\" on its own? Do you wish robots also were leveled up? Do you find it odd that blowing a robot's arm up causes it to just die like it was some sort of squishy organic being? Do you find it odd that robots that have been wandering around 200 years can go down with a few pipe pistol shots? Want Sentry Bots to be the monstrous machines they were meant to be?\n<br />\n<br />This mod is for you. \n<br />\n<br />This \"unofficial\" addition to [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/users/8515543]Zzyxzz[/url]'s \"[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/3815]Better Locational Damage[/url]\" does to robots what \"Ghoul Edition\" does for ghouls, but much differently. \n<br />\n<br />[/size][list]\n<br />[*][size=3]Robots now operate on a sort of \"Mechwarrior\" type system: Robots no longer take health damage simply by shooting at their arms, legs, and head. [u]They only take damage if you shoot at the torso (where the reactor is). [/u]However, doing so will still cripple them, and blowing their arms off will still cause them to self-destruct. In some cases, it may actually be MORE beneficial to destroy their limbs than it is to destroy the core itself.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Affects Protectrons, Handies/Gutsies, Assaultrons, Robobrains, Sentries, and (Gen 1/2) Synths.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Robots are tougher to destroy in general. After all, they've been operational for over 200 years in most cases, a raider with a pipe pistol or the stray molerat isn't going to do much to them.[/size]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][size=3]Protectrons and Handies/Gutsies are still bottom of the barrel, but are still tougher than they are in vanilla. You will find it rather difficult to destroy one with a pipe pistol.﻿  [/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Assaultrons are military-grade melee robots. You'll need concentrated fire to take one down.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Robobrains are very strong enemies now.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Sentry Bots are almost deathclaw-tier level threats. ﻿﻿[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Synths are a bit stronger than protectrons, but FAR weaker than assaultrons. Keep in mind that they also love to travel in packs. You'll quickly see why the commonwealth farmers fear these things so much.[/size]\n<br />[/list][/list]   ﻿[font=Tahoma][size=2]   ﻿(Keep in mind that in the case of Automatron Robots, a robot's \"race\" is determined by their [u]legs[/u], NOT by their torsos. A Robot that has a protectron head, a robobrain body, assaultron arms, and sentry bot legs counts as a sentry bot, not as a robobrain or protectron. I know this is weird, but that's something hard-coded into vanilla, there's nothing I can do about this sadly.)[/size][/font]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][size=3]Pulse Grenades/Mines and the Lightning Gun are more effective against robots now.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Just to make sure Automatron isn't a complete nightmare, Rust Devil and Mechanist robots take a bit more damage.[/size]\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[size=4]I recommend you run this with my other mod, [/size][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/39552][size=4]Automatron Randomized Bots[/size][/url][size=4], as well as the aformentioned \"Better Locational Damage\" mod. [/size][size=3]Neither are necessary, however.\n<br />\n<br />[/size][size=6][b]FAQ:\n<br />[/b][/size][list]\n<br />[*][size=3][b]\"What about Turrets, Eyebots, and Vertibirds? Are those effected too?\"[/b] [/size]\n<br />[size=3]No. They are not effected. Turrets and Eyebots are too weak to be worth the bother. As for Vertibirds, that has its own mod I just released, [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/41919]Better Vertibirds - A Vertibird Overhaul[/url]﻿. [/size][*][size=3][b]\"Are the robots I create affected too?\"[/b] [/size]\n<br />[size=3]Yes, yes they are. [i]Keep in mind that as mentioned above, a robot's race (and therefore the amount of protection they get) is determined by their [u]LEGS[/u], not by their torso.[/i][/size][*][size=3][b]\"Why do I need Far Harbor?\"[/b] [/size]\n<br />[size=3]Because Far Harbor has its own version of the Robobrain race. [/size][*][size=3][b]\"Can I use this without Better Locational Damage?\"[/b] [/size]\n<br />[size=3]Yes, you can. While it is meant to compliment that mod, just like that mod's \"Ghoul Edition,\" this mod can be used stand alone, so you can use it with something like Unbogus if you wish, or just by itself.[/size][*][size=3][b]\"Are there any scripts?\"[/b] [/size]\n<br />[size=3]Nope. No scripts.[/size][*][size=3][b]\"Load Order?\"[/b] [/size]\n<br />[size=3]On the bottom. It's a ES(L)P, so it will not take up ESP space. Just a bare minimum of ESL space.[/size][*][size=3][b]\"Can I port this to Xbox/PS4/Beth.net?\"[/b] [/size]\n<br />[size=3]Yes, you can. I do not care. [u]Keep in mind that if I do update this, you are responsible for keeping it updated.

Now the builders will check the LargeItemFormList and output items appropriately. Also added a delay for building large items to prevent items from being thrown.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]Added better checking in the disassembler code to prevent papyrus errors.

Thanks for the Assist pfarthing6![/size]\n<br />[/list]v.2.2.1 - Some small user requested changes\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][size=2]The weapon and armor scrappers now run on a shorter timer. This change is to speed up the scrapping process (Due to a possible engine error with Papyrus, not as fast as I would like). [/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]The main \"Better Manufacturing.esp\" is not tagged as an esm file and will operate like a standard esp file.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]Added back the standard Cutting Fluid recipe.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]All \"Gun\" weapons no longer require the BM keyword \"IsMachineScrapable\", making them far less likely to have any conflict with other mods.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]Made some small fixes to the type extractor to ensure it operates correctly. Ammo did not work correctly so I removed the ability to add that type altogether.[/size]\n<br />[/list][size=2]v.2.2 - Huge Patch. Adds quite a bit.\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]All disassemblers' scrap output has been adjusted to equalize the new armor scrap output. With the great extent of items it was very tedious to make the scrap out for each specific item. What I did instead was create generic scrap recipes and add randomization to them to add variation to scrapping and balance. Before, weapons and armor all scrapped to very close to normal vanilla scrapping on a workbench WITHOUT any randomization. Now they all have a low chance to double up on certain valuable resources, along with other random balances. \n<br />[*]The Armor Scrapper is now full functional on ALL items in the ARMOR category, that includes clothing, hats. facemasks, ect. I even got all of the armor from ArmorSmith extended since I'm using AWKCR keywords including the Jetpacks and weapon aesthetics! \n<br />[*]Armor pieces will also scrap without a BM keyword, meaning ANY other Mod that adds armor should be compatible with the Disassembler WITHOUT fo4edits (As long as they are tagged with AWKCR keywords or Vanilla Armor Keywords). \n<br />[*][color=#3c78d8]There is now a new Scrapper for Ammo! Due to the complexity of ammo scrapping, I had to add a separate machine. It scraps 25 of ANY ammo at a time, with the exception being large ammo items such as mini nukes. missiles, ect. [/color]\n<br />[*]Adds a brand new type extractor! Put an object of a certain type in and this pulls all objects of that type out of the local workbench onto a conveyor.[color=#ff0000] [/color][color=#00ff00]MUST READ: This Object required a very heavy operation involving the Workbench Inventory (One of the reasons this thing does not link). Because of that it actually LOCKS the workbench when this thing runs its search. If you attempt to access the inventory while it's processing all items will \"Appear\" to be missing. They are not, the workbench is just locked. I recommend one per settlement max (trust me, that's all you need)! [/color]\n<br />[*][color=#3c78d8]Adds the Equipment Sorter by steamcanuck.[/color]\n<br />[*]I also add Left Facing Sorters (All included)! These things are great and allow you to sort left as well. No more weird factory right only setups, or upward lifts everywhere! I also overwrote the scripts to use the BM Faster Hopper Script and tagged them to the Faster Hopper Terminal. That means they are now linked to your faster hopper terminal settings. \n<br />[*]I noticed downward lifts were not grabbing items correctly due to the Trigger point being too high. This patch fixes those so they have lower trigger points on ALL lifts. \n<br />[*][color=#3c78d8]Combined the Butcher and Robot Disassembler into one machine called the Body Decomposer and added a Large Hopper version as well! You know the one with the Huge Open top to make butchering easier. [/color]\n<br />[*]Added a bunch of missing items to the LargeItem Form List from the Contraptions DLC . This is aimed at fixing any hopper and builder when outputting large items. I even added Weaponsmith extended Large Items if you get that patch. \n<br />[/list]v.2.1.3 - Small Bug fixes.[color=#3c78d8] Adds ME Power Armor Kits to the Full Armor Builder[/color]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][u]BUG_FIX:[/u] Fixed the missing component value on Fat Scrap. \n<br />[*]This also significantly reduces the weight of fat scrap.

If you don't it can cause crashes and bugs as the machines are now using different scripts essentially an the ones already placed have no script to point to. This affects ANY and ALL BM machines and conveyors. I realize the hassle this presents and I apologize. These are things I am just now learning. \n<br />\n<br />If you downloaded any versions 1.5 - 1.9.4 you have a potential for problems with conveyors and builders that had more than 16 recipes. You will probably not see any immediate issues and maybe none at all but it is bad practice to overwrite a Vanilla Script and use that instead of creating your own script. The reason is that it introduces multiple versions  of the same script in your deploy directory. One in the BA2 file and one in Scripts/DLC05. As you can see that is not good, and the only reason it works is because the Scripts/ directory overwrites BA2's. I'm terribly sorry for this mistake, I'm still learning myself and these things happen. I fixed this in 1.9.5, please download the latest version ASAP.

This mod adds the Cybernetics Lab Workbench, and several pieces of armor (and a pair of RoboHand-gloves), each with a significant amount of customization including vanilla lining mods, special Gadget mods, advanced Frame mods, cybernetic implants, firmware upgrades, and 20+ paint/pattern options. The main pieces have light/medium/heavy variations, and the 'RoboHand' gloves can be modded to be exclusive to either the left/right hand. Most items are worn as armor and generally will fit with vanilla outfits (RoboGloves cant be worn with some vanilla 'gloved' outfits)\n<br />\n<br />A note on Bodyscales:\n<br />The vanilla game uses a funky system to scale over-armor to fit cleanly over under-clothing, this system works alright for the relatively small armors of the vanilla game, but for the Cyber armatures it can be a little aggressive. You might notice while wearing certain under-clothes (army fatigues) you will get massive scaling on Cyber Armatures. There's no way to avoid this without editing vanilla items. My best advice is to stick to thin under-clothes like Vault suits, harnesses, and BoS uniforms. Additionally you can scale down your characters weight to average/skinny to offset most strange scaling. The first-person models Have been specially made to not clip over the pipboy at any size. You will need another mod if you wish to hide the \n<br />pipboy in 3rd person, this mod will not do that for you.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />CBBE Bodyslide files are included for female versions, these may help with clipping, but are not necessary.\n<br />\n<br />Screenshot auto-approve is turned on, I'm sure most of you can take better screenshots than my potato computer can!\n<br />\n<br />There is a Palette guide in the screenshots that can help you find the color you want.\n<br />\n<br />[img]http://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/8609-0-1454997180.jpg[/img]\n<br />\n<br />[center]™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™[/center]\n<br />[img]http://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/8609-1-1453151432.jpg[/img]\n<br />\n<br />[img]http://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/8609-0-1453155310.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />All of the main items of this mod are made at the Cyber Crafting Bench. Once made they can be customized at an armor bench, paint/palette swaps cost nothing, some of the more advanced mods and armors have long parts lists, so remember to scroll the component list!\n<br

Marine armor left arm\n<br />Reshaped the Marine armor 1st person mesh to fit the pipboy better\n<br />\n<br />[size=5]v1.06b\n<br />[/size]fixed a missing Palette Texture\n<br />\n<br />[size=5]v1.06a[/size]\n<br />[b]Added a new Palette version[/b]: v4 Vibrant\n<br />-These colors are generally brighter than the other palettes, but not all are, one example is pictured above.\n<br />[b]Added Marine armor[/b]\n<br />-Better stats than top end Combat armor, Marine armor is the new top tier medium armor for Cybernetics.\n<br />-Note that this tier requires Far Harbor assets to display correctly, the stats will still work but the meshes will not display correctly.\n<br />[b]Rebuilt the male arm meshes[/b]\n<br />-Much less bulky\n<br />-Still looks best with an 'average' body type with the in-game slider, though high muscle builds can still work without excessive scaling\n<br />-Some outfits (ie: army fatigues) still have strange scaling, this is a vanilla issue\n<br />Reworked some component costs of Armor mods\n<br />-Most notably removed the need for Ballistic Fiber when crafting Raider Style armors\n<br />Fixed some object mod descriptions\n<br />Big nerf to Antimicrobial Cleanser\n<br />-This was hilariously overpowered in Survival\n<br />-Heals rads at about .3 rads persecond down from 3 rads per second\n<br />-Still retains its usefulness, but the heal is much more passive and gives radaway some value back\n<br />Removed the tiny 1 extra value/armor/energy resist/weight from palette mods\n<br />\n<br />[size=5]v1.05a[/size]\n<br />[size=3][b]REMOVED the need for AWKCR and Cosmetic Framework[/b][/size]\n<br />--The mod is 100% standalone now, no other mods or masters needed.\n<br />[size=3][b]ADDED T-51 heavy tier armor[/b][/size]\n<br />--makes full use of all palette colors\n<br />--unpainted allows you to use the classic coloration with a green chest and steel arms/legs\n<br />ADDED jump height leg gadget\n<br />--roughly doubles your jump height\n<br />ADDED Auto-medic Torso Gadget\n<br />--Unlike the PA version, the Auto-Medic still plays the stimpack animation\n<br />ADDED more stat bonus psudo-legendary mods\n<br />--Also reworked the recipe costs of the original Uni mods\n<br />--Generally each stat requires a large investment of a specific material, and a handful of nuclear material\n<br />--These are still interchangeable, and can be moved between armatures\n<br />--The Upper-Lower Connector also had a slot added for UniFrame mods, to make up for only having one for both legs\n<br />ADDED Inventory and ground models for most items\n<br />REWORKED most crafting recipes\n<br />--Lists should be MUCH shorter\n<br />--Rather than small amounts of lots of different things, most items now require a moderate amount of a few different things\n<br />REWORKED the Cyberlab\n<br />--With the keyword cap issue resolved the workbench can return without bloating keyword usage\n<br />--All armatures and extras (Belt/hands) are crafted at the new (old) workbench now\n<br />--The workbench can also be used to craft stuff from other CROSS mods that have been updated for it\n<br />--Not all CROSS mods are updated to use this yet, but its worth checking if you hate making cool stuff at the boring chemlab!\n<br />\n<br />[size=5]v1.03a[/size]\n<br />[b]Added the much requested feature to hide the chest straps on the arms.[/b]   \n<br />-This shows up like a new mod category in the mod menu for each arm\n<br />-by default on newly crafted armatures they are enabled\n<br />-on updating you should see an extra \"material\" category at the bottom of the the armor-mod list, this is where the toggle for the straps is.\n<br />All Torso meshes were updated to work with the Jetpack (and any other addons I might add down the line)\n<br />-They won't look any different, but trust me they are. \n<br />-If you've customized any torso meshes from this mod they likely won't work with the Jetpack mod without being tweaked.\n<br />\n<br />[size=5]v1.02a[/size]\n<br />[b]Added Raider armor mods[/b]\n<br />-Includes medium and heavy versions for arms/legs, and lite/med/heavy torso (lite has less garbage over the head)\n<br />-These use v1, v3, and vBoS palettes\n<br />-Polished/chrome versions can still be used, but they will not effect the raider armor, just the baseframe.\n<br />-Balance wise the raider versions are about the same as combat med/heavy, and slightly easier to make, with the major caveat of being extra heavy.\n<br />Cleaned up a few first person meshes that were still clipping occasionally\n<br />Moved Material swap records off of the Cosmetic Framework and back into the ESP for ease of updating.\n<br />[b]Combined exo-frame and Unibelt optional addons into Cybernetics[/b]\n<br />-You'll have to remake items from those addons, and Robohands may need to have color/texture reconfigured.\n<br />-you should disable those addons if you were previously running them, but other than losing the exo-frame/belt there shouldn't be any issue.\n<br />-If you don't disable those addons you will have duplicates in the AWKCR crafting menu, and existing items will likely be unmoddable.\n<br />\n<br />[size=5]v1.01b[/size]\n<br />Moved several shared components to a master file which further helps deal with the keyword cap.\n<br />-this also makes some of my other mods no longer dependent on this one.\n<br />Added a Chrome version of the BoS Palette, shiny!\n<br />More back end cleanup\n<br />\n<br />[size=5]v1.01[/size]\n<br />Added Light Combat Armor Arms\n<br />Dropped the unique crafting bench\n<br />-All wearables are crafted under CYBERTECH category of AWKCR armorsmith bench\n<br />-All mods are crafted at armor workbench\n<br />-Make sure to update exo-frame addon otherwise you will no longer be able to craft the exo-frames.\n<br />Re-added the unique crafting bench as an alternative armorbench\n<br />-functions exactly like a vanilla armor modding bench\n<br />Fixed a bad IsMoving comparison that was draining stamina incorrectly on movement based gadgets\n<br />Fixed Low Noise conversion's description to include the 10% movespeed while sneaking it has always provided.\n<br />Significant clean-up of torso/arm meshes\n<br />-Better rigging overall, less twisting metal parts\n<br />Minor adjustments to the v3 baseframe diffuse map\n<br />Included a \"NoRobotFootStepSounds\" esp file that removes the robotic noise when running/walking with leg armatures equipped (effects exo-legs as well) \n<br />\n<br />[size=5]v1.00[/size]\n<br />Added full legs\n<br />-Leg armatures are a single piece of armor for both legs, because it looks ridiculous to only wear one at a time\n<br />-armor values on are generally double their vanilla equivalent because obviously they are 2 armor slots in one\n<br />-natural +50 carryweight\n<br />-Robot footsteps!\n<br />-Full Palette/Index mod support\n<br />Added a lower torso item that works like the lower exo-legs to connect upper/lower frames\n<br />-uses the same slot as exo-legs, and can be palette/index modded\n<br />-Animates better for the cyber-legs than the exo-leg connector, though exo-legs provide the same functionality\n<br />Added Lite/Med/Heavy Combat armor upgrades for legs\n<br />Added t45 armor upgrade for legs\n<br />-Connect to upper frame via a secondary torso armature, or with exo frame to negate mobility penalty\n<br />Reduced mod category keywords for general keyword cap compatibility\n<br />Removed the 'friendly-names' of palette index mods\n<br />-these were never very accurate, read the area below the description for a more accurate description of color placements.\n<br />\n<br />[size=6][size=5]v.094[/size][/size]\n<br />Enabled the 'full-support' system\n<br />-full-support is provided by wearing linked leg armatures as well as either (or both) a linked exo-arm frame, or the Pre-war Cybernetics Torso.\n<br />Enabled two new arm gadgets that require full support. (Currently you will need the exo-frame addon to use legs mods, until full pre-war cybernetic legs are finished)\n<br />-Grounded Stabilizer -Eliminates all scope sway, and reduces bullet spread by 20% while crouched and not moving. Requires connected spine and leg supports.\n<br />-High Impact Reinforcement -Sprinting into enemies can stagger them. Requires connected spine and leg supports, as well as secondary gadget on arm/legs.\n<br />Enabled new unique mods for leg armatures. (currently requires exo-frame addon)\n<br />-Load bearing 1, 2, and 3, - provides 25, 50, and 100 carryweight.\n<br />-HighSpeed Servos - Movespeed increased by 10%. VATS Melee distance increased by 100%.\n<br />-Pneumatic Upgrade - Negates 80% of fall damge, and increases Swim Speed by 15%.\n<br />-Move assist Actuators - Reduced Sprint cost by 50%\n<br />-Low Noise Conversion - Sneaking is 40% quieter, but drains 4 AP per sec while moving.\n<br />-High Impact - Sprinting into enemies can stagger them. Requires connected spine and leg supports, as well as secondary gadget on arm/legs.\n<br />Power Armor modded armatures now have a mobility reduction mechanic for each piece equipped.\n<br />-this mobility penalty can be negated by wearing a full frame (Connected legs as well as a torso support item).\n<br />Improved on the Robo hand meshes for male and female.\n<br />-better overall shape.\n<br />-No more bulky wristwrap.\n<br />Updated Combat armor torso texture.\n<br />Added a BoS themed Palette\n<br />Altered how Palette Indexes are described, which should give a better idea of the colors they apply and where they are applied.\n<br />\n<br />[size=5]v0.93[/size]\n<br />ADDED palette v3. This is a further cleaned up texture/palette. v1 and v2 are still available.\n<br />Finished the t-45 PowerPlated Chest, which now has (the good parts of) a proper t45 torso.\n<br />-the Included bodyslide files for the t45 chest have 'size limits' so as to keep their overall shape up to a decent size.\n<br />Power Armor modded armatures have had their armor value increased significantly.\n<br />MOVED Synth hands into the regular PA hands\n<br />-Synth versions are now variations of the original hands (similar to how you switch between left/right/both).\n<br />Implemented Dynamic Naming for weight/style/Palette Index.\n<br />-You will probably have to rebuild armatures if updating from previous versions to get dynamic naming working.\n<br />Altered the 'winterized' palette index\n<br />-this was basically a third 'white' option and didnt look as good as the other two.\n<br />-while on the v2/3 palette this is nowa vibrant purple-yellow\n<br />-unchanged on palette v1\n<br />Significant file clean-up and reduced keyword usage\n<br />-All armature mods now ride on vanilla keywords now.\n<br />-This has the added bonus of making the mod menu list more ordered.\n<br />Removed the belt from Combat armor variations of the Torso armor\n<br />Fixed an issue with hands showing through gloves when using other mods that split up the hand meshes.\n<br />Fixed a filepath issue with high specular synth hand textures.\n<br />Altered the stats on base armors/mods to bring them more in line with similar vanilla armors.\n<br />Added some behind the scenes stuff to set up for legs.\n<br />\n<br />[size=5]v0.92[/size]\n<br />Added medium and lite Combat armor torso mods\n<br />Added medium combat armor arm mod.\n<br />Added a poison resistance spine implant.\n<br />Added two new \"entry level\" firmware mods\n<br />-LockBumper, while equipped all novice locks are impossible to fail. Easier to make than the other lockpick firmware.\n<br />-Trajectory Calculator, enables the throwing arc on grenades/Molotovs while equipped.\n<br />Cleaned up some old paint jobs to make use of Palette mods on parts they normally would leave at default.\n<br />--IE you can now have the Red forearm paint and still change the color of armor over the top of the painted frame.\n<br />Added Palette version 2.1\n<br />--This is an updated frame texture, other textures still on v2. Includes a Chrome 2.1\n<br />Cleaned up some records in the RoboGloves reference. Might help with crashing some people seem to have.\n<br />Added Synth hands. \n<br />--These function exactly like the regular the PA Frame hands.\n<br />--Can be swapped between Both/Left/Right at an armor bench.\n<br />--Can use Palettes, or be left unpainted.\n<br />\n<br />[size=5]v0.91[/size]\n<br />Added Heavy Combat armor versions of the medium armor.\n<br />-These are a heavy weight alternative to the kelogg armor and can be crafted with armorer rank 3.\n<br />Marked the \"brace\" center size options as WIP. \n<br />-These still need the t-45 chest and some other kind of armor added to these. For now they retain stats as if they had proper armor.\n<br />Removed the extra workbench entry which should clean up the workshop bloat a bit.\n<br />Moved Paletted 'material' mods to a new Armor-mod class: Palette Index. \n<br />-This allows more universal color swapping across palette versions.\n<br />Added a second palette version, which can be swapped to like custom paint jobs.\n<br />Renamed palette colors slightly, generally the colors are the same across v1 and v2, but colors with color1/color2 are respective to v1/v2.\n<br />Renamed \"polished\" custom paint and added Chrome Paint.\n<br />-These are now based on Palette versions.\n<br />-Polished applies a brighter specular map than normal to v1.\n<br /> -Chrome applies a very bright specular map to v2.\n<br />-Because these work like palettes any palette index color can be polished/chromed.\n<br />Added an amateurish attempt at upping the resolution of the Frame/Gloves, only applies to v2 palette and v2 Chrome.\n<br />Paint and palette index changes are now free.\n<br />Fixed some 1st person clipping issues with specific guns.\n<br />\n<br />Added a second ESP for people having issues with the unique crafting station.\n<br />-This ESP makes all armatures and advanced mods craft-able at the CHEMLAB, they must still be APPLIED at the armor bench.\n<br />-If you are still having issues with crafting items with this debug-esp the issue is likely related to overall bloat from large amounts of mods.\n<br />[center]™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™[/center]\n<br />[img]http://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/8609-3-1453151432.jpg[/img]\n<br />The base limb armatures are nearly free and buildable easily at early levels, with the torso piece being the first major upgrade. Vanilla-standard armor mods/Paint/Size-mods can be applied for standard progression. From there things get more complex, the more unique Firmware/Implant/gadget/frame mods are significantly more powerful than vanilla armor mods and require more than just Armorsmith and Science perks, as well as large investments of rare components.\n<br />\n<br />Many of the unique mods require more than just the basic crafting perks, for example the lockpicking auto-picker mod requires both locksmith1 and robotics-expert1. The general idea is that CyberArm mods support a more role-playing playstyle and reward you for branching out your perk tree instead of just taking the few perks that really matter.

By default there are three nude options available that don't require anything but installation, as well as [url=http://vintagedancer.com/1950s/1950s-lingerie]lore-friendly underwear[/url] styles for these body shapes (using Beth's own unused underwear meshes).\n<br />\n<br />These meshes have a total of over 21k vertices - compared to the vanilla body's modest 1750 - for optimal smoothness. In tests there have been no reports of these high-poly meshes causing any slow down, but may still be too much for weaker systems to use, so be warned. \n<br />\n<br />Included in the main installer are bodies, textures, all vanilla and DLC outfits, and BodySlide addons for the body and outfits.\n<br />There are also morph files for the body and the outfits included, which are used for in-game morphing with [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/12631/]LooksMenu[/url] or other script mods.\n<br />\n<br />Also, in the Optional downloads, are files for the CBBE Reduced bodies.

Ensure you have entered all three lines into your .ini and all files listed in Troubleshooting are present in your game directory. Make sure the file is called Fallout4Custom.ini, not Fallout4Custom.ini.txt (un-hide file extensions)!\n<br />[color=#a0fff0]A2:[/color] If NPCs have changed, but your player character hasn't, you're using a mod that changes the directory for the player body meshes/textures, such as 'Unique Player'. You'll need to install matching meshes/textures manually.\n<br />[color=#a0fff0]A3:[/color] If your player character has changed, but NPCs haven't, you're using a mod that changes the directory for NPC body meshes/textures. You'll need to install the meshes/textures manually.\n<br />[color=#a0fff0]A4:[/color] You're not looking at a nude female adult character or are currently wearing an outfit that's not CBBE-compatible.\n<br />[color=#a0fff0]A5:[/color] Your mod manager is being buggy or there's a user error. The installer is bug free, or there would be more people reporting issues. If you're using NMM, make sure you're using the latest files from GitHub.\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][color=#ffff60]Q2:[/color] Why am I getting patchwork body textures (black shoulder, nipple on stomach or painted-on underwear)?[/size]\n<br />[color=#a0fff0]A1:[/color] You didn't follow the instructions in the installation section. Ensure you have entered all three lines into your .ini and all files listed in Troubleshooting are present in your game directory. Make sure the file is called Fallout4Custom.ini, not Fallout4Custom.ini.txt!\n<br />[color=#a0fff0]A2:[/color] You have a conflict somewhere. Make sure you don't have any other mods that affect or overwrote the body.\n<br />[color=#a0fff0]A3:[/color] You're not using a CBBE-compatible outfit or texture on a CBBE body. At the very least, you should install the vanilla outfits/default textures found in the main file's installer.\n<br />[color=#a0fff0]A4:[/color] You're using a mod that changes the directory for the body meshes/textures. You'll need to install matching meshes/textures manually.\n<br />[color=#a0fff0]A5:[/color] Elderly women are not officially supported by this mod. Install the elderly textures found [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/7432]here[/url].\n<br />[color=#a0fff0]A6:[/color] Mannequins (Contraptions DLC) are not officially supported. Try [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/15821]this mod[/url].\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][color=#ffff60]Q3:[/color] How do I fix the texture mismatch at the back of the player/NPC head?[/size]\n<br />[color=#a0fff0]A:[/color] Activate the CBBE.esp to fix it. This only works for the player character (see below for more info).\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][color=#ffff60]Q4:[/color] Why does FO4's CBBE have a plugin when Skyrim's did not?[/size]\n<br />[color=#a0fff0]A:[/color] A lot of space was wasted on the vanilla body UV map (how a texture lines up on a mesh - the 3D model), and part of the head texture (the rear) was included as part of the body texture. FO4 CBBE's UV map is almost exactly the same as Skyrim's, making it easier for modders to convert body textures over or make new ones, and filling up the wasted space. But as a result, the part of the UV map used for the head is taken up by our leg texture.  The plugin corrects this by pointing the head rear to a duplicated, vanilla body texture (femalebhed.dds). The plugin is optional if you have hair covering your head rear or can ignore the issue.\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][color=#ffff60]Q5:[/color] Why does the plugin for the head mismatch only work for the player?[/size]\n<br />[color=#a0fff0]A:[/color] Each NPC in FO4 has its own head texture -  in Skyrim, the texture was shared with the player, with only skin tone/makeup/scars/warpaint being unique to the NPC. This is why your shiny new face texture doesn't work with NPCs and why fixing the back of the head is harder than just a quick texture swap.\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][color=#ffff60]Q6:[/color] Why are some of the vanilla outfits so 'jaggy'?[/size]\n<br />[color=#a0fff0]A1:[/color] Most of the outfits are low poly because they are the vanilla outfits directly edited to work with CBBE/BodySlide. We didn't have time to remake all the outfits with a higher poly count, as it's a lot of work. A few, such as the vault suit or dresses, have been granted additional polygons.\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][color=#ffff60]Q7:[/color] Do outfits or body textures not specifically made for CBBE work with it?[/size]\n<br />[color=#a0fff0]A:[/color] Only body textures made to work with CBBE will show up correctly in all places, as CBBE has different UV maps for texture alignment. Outfits that show skin in any way need to be compatible with CBBE to match up. You'll have to (nicely) ask the creator to make a version of their mod for CBBE or convert the outfit yourself using Outfit Studio, or the textures using Photoshop/GIMP/etc.\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][color=#ffff60]Q8:[/color] Will there be a male version?[/size]\n<br />[color=#a0fff0]A:[/color] We would like to but are mostly lacking the time. Try the [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/10360]Super Hero Bodies by smorris2012[/url], which can be customized using BodySlide.\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][color=#ffff60]Q9:[/color] How do I make this player-only?[/size]\n<br />[color=#a0fff0]A:[/color] Install a mod like '[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/3718]Unique Player[/url]' and follows its instructions. Note that outfits won't be unique unless you duplicate their game entry yourself or have your player character only use standalone modded outfits. The linked unique player mod also doesn't support 1st person meshes properly, so you could get issues with the hand seams in 1st person. Better would be to install one of the default bodies for all NPCs to use, and use the in-game morphs with BodySlide and LooksMenu to make your character have her own shape (this would also mean all compatible outfits will morph to your character's shape when worn).\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][color=#ffff60]Q10:[/color] Will you put this on Bethesda.net?[/size]\n<br />[color=#a0fff0]A:[/color]  CBBE and its outfits are[url=https://bethesda.net/en/mods/fallout4/mod-detail/4061893] now on Bethesda.net.[/url]\n<br />\n<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/KhIHYTg.png[/img]\n<br />If the mod appears not to be working, the most common cause is incorrectly placed files.

There should be no reason to run more than one of any given item simultaneously, and the corresponding logic is coded to catch this, in order to help prevent potential issues.\r<br />\r<br />Activating a tool will &#34;consume&#34; it but then return another almost immediately afterward.\r<br />Then, the corresponding script will then search the area in a radius roughly equal to what can be chosen from the holotape.\r<br />These values are very loose approximations, and were formed from documentation for the Skyrim version of the Creation Kit; they should still be suitable, but don&#39;t rely on them for any sort of precision.\r<br />\r<br />A notification will appear in the corner of the screen indicating the progress of various collection routines within the given radius.\r<br />Then, each appropriate item will be processed, and anything yielded will eventually make its way to the user.\r<br />The transfer interface for a container may open to show some collected items, depending on the tool used, but no items can be put into it or taken out from it - just close this and the items will be added.\r<br />\r<br />The configuration holotape supports various options for each tool added, including configuring the harvester to harvest flora, or to harvest corpses as well.\r<br />The items on any corpse within the harvesting radius will be pooled and presented to the player in the same manner as other yielded items.\r<br />Additionally, the holotape supports running both flora and corpse harvesting &#34;at the same time&#34;.\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]This will in reality run first the flora harvesting and then the corpse harvesting back-to-back, saving the user from having to change the configuration every time if they want to use all features from this mod.\r<br />[/list]Flora harvesting can be set to ignore or enforce a requirement that flora not be harvested if that would be stealing for the user; the default behavior is to ignore this requirement.\r<br />Corpse harvesting can be set to ignore or enforce a requirement that the actor in question have been killed by the user; the default behavior is to ignore this requirement.\r<br />\r<br />The Junk Vacuum will always collect loose items lying in the world around the player, and uses its own, separate radius.\r<br />The Junk Vacuum can be configured to either process or ignore items considered stealing for the user, or even to strip ownership information.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#b6d7a8][size=4][b]Compatibility[/b][/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />This doesn&#39;t alter anything from the base game, so it should be fairly compatible with most mods.\r<br />As such, the load order shouldn&#39;t matter too much, but any optional patches will of course need to be below both the base plugin for this mod and the DLC/mod agains which the compatibility patch should run. For example, something like this:\r<br />Fallout4.esm\r<br />[...other DLC...]\r<br />DLCCoast.esm\r<br />[...other DLC...]\r<br />[...other ESMs...]\r<br />Homemaker.esm\r<br />[...other ESMs...]\r<br />[...other ESPs...]\r<br />Rdr-Harvesting.esp\r<br />Rdr-Harvesting-DLCCoast.esp\r<br />Rdr-Harvesting-Homemaker.esp\r<br />[...other ESPs...]\r<br />\r<br />Any mod that adds custom flora or junk items won&#39;t work without a patch.\r<br />If you have a mod that you really want added you can add a comment or PM me and I can have a look, or you can just make your own patch that adds the new flora to the form list of flora from the base plugin file.\r<br />Any mod that changes the ingestible yielded by pre-existing flora records should work, however, provided that it is against the same flora base object and loads before this mod.\r<br />\r<br />This should be compatible with most mods that add new NPCs, provided that they use the keywords shared by other NPCs in the game.\r<br />Custom races may possibly introduce problems with being harvested, however, though the scripting tries fairly hard to find all valid corpses.\r<br />\r<br />This mod is compatible with the [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/4397]Graygarden Planters - Quest Reward[/url] mod, without any patch being necessary, as tested with version 0.3.0 of that mod.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#b6d7a8][size=4][b]Disclaimers[/b][/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />Try to be gentle with the scripts; I tried to account for most situations, but some activities might cause some trouble, like the following:\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]Fast-travelling away from the activation area immediately after using the item\r<br />[*]Spam-activating multiple tools within a very short period of time, or quickly changing the harvesting radius between these\r<br />[*]Trying to coerce actors other than the player into using the tools; while the scripts were written the be agnostic to whoever used it, this has not been tested\r<br />[*]Installing/uninstalling the mod or DLC plugins, or saving and exiting, while the tools are running; saving and exiting should work, but is not recommended (especially between updating the mod)\r<br />[/list]\r<br />The harvester should never take very long to finish, and if it does then something has probably gone wrong; corpses may take longer though.\r<br />You may want to consider saving before each activation, because I had some early issues in testing with the game freezing after collecting from larger numbers of harvestables.\r<br />\r<br />This mod has had some light testing to ensure that it functions as expected, but keep in mind that this is just an early release and bugs are very possible.\r<br />Please send any suggestions/bug reports my way, and I will do my best to address them.\r<br />\r<br />Try not to travel too far too quickly while the harvester is running; it uses an invisible container to give items to the player, and if this is inaccessible at just the right moment the mod may have unpredictable behavior.\r<br />\r<br />The usual warnings for mods apply - I am not responsible for anything bad that may happen to your saves/game/computer/etc., use at your own risk, ...\r<br />\r<br />Please do not upload this elsewhere.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#b6d7a8][size=4][b]Plans[/b][/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*][s]Looking into adding rudimentary support for junk collection.[/s] Done&#33; Introduced in V0.3.0 (2016-07-19)\r<br />[*][s]Generalize harvesting script to allow for items that aren&#39;t strictly flora, or in corpses.[/s] Done&#33; Introduced, with just Mirelurk Eggs to start, in V0.2.2 (2016-06-30)\r<br />[*][s]Looking into adding experimental support for corpses.[/s] Done&#33; Introduced in V0.2.0 (2016-06-30)\r<br />[/list][center]\r<br />My Fallout 4 mods:\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]Collection Tools\r<br />[/list][list]\r<br />[*][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/17043]Settlement Equipment[/url]\r<br />[/list][list]\r<br />[*][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/20367]Curie Romance Dialogue Fix[/url]\r<br />[/list][/center]",

Phew. It's quiet. Too quiet. You turn and see your companion grovelling about on the floor. Thanks for nothing, Piper - you mutter for the fifteen-thousandth time this week.\n<br />\n<br />In vanilla, there's absolutely no way to know how much health your companion has left. Their HP bar doesn't show when you point at them, and they're not selectable in VATS either. You have no idea if your companion is just fine or right about to go down face flat on the very next hit.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f6b26b][font=Courier New][size=5][b]★ THE DETAILS ★[/b][/size][/font][/color]\n<br />\n<br />This mod adds a HUD widget that displays your companions' health and stats. Up to ten companions can be monitored.\n<br />\n<br />Stats will be displayed when companions enter combat, and will automatically fade out once your companion is at full health and out of combat.\n<br />\n<br />You can now have an improved situational awareness of your team's fighting strength. If they're low on health, call them back or reposition them. Provide support where needed. Know the status and fighting strength of your team at all times.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f6b26b][font=Courier New][size=5][b]★ REQUIREMENTS ★[/b][/size][/font][/color]\n<br />\n<br />This mod requires [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/20309/]HUDFramework[/url].\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f6b26b][font=Courier New][size=5][b]★ COMPATIBILITY ★[/b][/size][/font][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Automatically compatible with all follower systems, vanilla or mod-added, present or future.\n<br />\n<br />All that's required is for followers to have the [i]Treat as Player Follower[/i] flag correctly set on their AI packages. This is set by default on the FollowPlayer package template, so a mod would have to be doing things in a very different way indeed in order to not have it set.\n<br />\n<br />Fully compatible with:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Vanilla follower system\n<br />[*]Temporary quest followers\n<br />[*]Everybody's Best Friend \n<br />[*]Unlimited Companion Framework\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f6b26b][font=Courier New][size=5][b]★ HOW DO I... ★[/b][/size][/font][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Q. Position the HUD widget?\n<br />A: Enter the console command [code][cqf companionstatus setpos &lt;x position&gt; &lt;y position&gt;][/code].\n<br />    Or the command [code][cqf companionstatus modpos &lt;x or y&gt; &lt;value&gt;][/code] to move the widget relative to its current position.\n<br />\n<br />Q. Scale the HUD widget?\n<br />A: Enter the console command [code][cqf companionstatus setscale &lt;value between 0 and 1&gt;][/code].\n<br />\n<br />Q. Set the opacity of the HUD widget?\n<br />A: Enter the console command [code][cqf companionstatus setopacity &lt;value between 0 and 1&gt;][/code].\n<br />\n<br />All these commands can be copied and pasted into the console.\n<br />\n<br />Sorry about making you use the console to do things like positioning and scaling. Until we have a MCM with fancy sliders, though, this will have to do! The upside is that you only need to configure just once - your settings are saved.

A few guides for the most common tasks can be found in the articles section of this page.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/40650/40650-1587550218-801393958.png[/img]\n<br />[u][b][color=#00ff00][size=4]Workbench[/size][/color][/b][/u]\n<br />\n<br />You can place stationary workbenches in settlements and player homes via the workshop menu, found under the Crafting category. The mobile versions can be crafted at any Chemistry Station in the CRAFTING FRAMEWORK category.\n<br />When starting a new game (upon leaving Vault 111) a single instance of the mobile Universal Workbench gets automatically added to the player's inventory. Those benches can be placed anywhere in the world by either dropping it from your inventory or using the AID items as a favourites hotkey (or MCM hotkeys). When you activate the workbench a menu appears. Every menu item can be disabled via holotape or optional MCM. Once you're done with crafting you can pack it up and transport in your inventory until you need it again.\n<br />The mobile power armor workbench works a bit different. It gets automatically packed up and send to your inventory once you leave the power armor crafting menu.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ff00][b]Menu Structure (click on Show to expand)[/b][/color]\n<br />[spoiler][list=1]\n<br />[*]Exit Menu\n<br />[*]Pack Up Workbench (only on the mobile version)\n<br />[*]Armor - Create\n<br />[*]Armor - Modify\n<br />[*]Weapon - Create\n<br />[*]Weapon - Modify\n<br />[*]Ammo Station\n<br />[*]Chem Station\n<br />[*]Junk Station\n<br />[*]Utility Station\n<br />[*]Cooking Stove\n<br />[/list][/spoiler]\n<br />[u][b][color=#00ff00][size=4]Equipment Modification[/size][/color][/b][/u]\n<br />\n<br />Crafting Framework uses the vanilla legendary slot as an entry point for its mechanics and functionality. Because of that, the mod is able to modify all kind of equipment without requiring patches for other mods or Creation Club content. Getting this feature up and running is simple:\n<br />[list=1]\n<br />[*]Go to a workbench of your choice and choose any kind of legendary mod option (even \"No Legendary Effect\" works here).\n<br />[*]This adds the main mod slot \"Legendary Enhancements\" which lets you pick and choose which additions you want to add to the item.\n<br />[*]Once you've selected one of the options new mod slots will be added to the item that hold a bunch of additional modifications for you to utilise.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />All the modifiers (damage, protection, recoil, etc.) aren't meant to be used as an additional progression system but rather tools to balance your items. In case you're applying a second legendary mod be aware that those effects won't show a legendary mod description but the effects will still apply.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#00ff00]Menu Structure (click on Show to expand):[/color][/b]\n<br />[spoiler][code]L1: Legendary Mod Slot\n<br />├─ UO: Unscrappable Option\n<br />└─ LE: Legendary Enhancements\n<br />   ├─ Armor Options\n<br />   │   ├─ AE: Armor Enhancement\n<br />   │   ├─ PM: Protection Modifier\n<br />   │   └─ JM: Jump Height Modifier\n<br />   ├─ Power Armor Options\n<br />   │   ├─ MA: Second Material\n<br />   │   ├─ MI: Second Misc\n<br />   │   ├─ PM: Protection Modifier\n<br />   │   └─ JM: Jump Height Modifier\n<br />   ├─ Gun Options\n<br />   │   ├─ AC: Ammo Conversion\n<br />   │﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿   ├─ PO: Projectile Override\n<br />   │   ├─ FM: Firing Mode\n<br />   │   ├─ ROF: Rate of Fire Modifier\n<br />   │   ├─ AM: Accuracy Modifier\n<br />   │   ├─ RM: Recoil Modifier\n<br />   │   ├─ RaM: Range Modifier\n<br />   │   ├─ RS: Reload Speed Modifier\n<br />   │   ├─ ZM: Zoom Modifier\n<br />   │   ├─ STM: Sighted Transition Modifier\n<br />   │   └─ DM: Damage Modifier\n<br />   ├─ Melee Options\n<br />   │   ├─ ME: Melee Enhancement\n<br />   │   └─ DM: Damage Modifier\n<br />   └─ Second Legendary\n<br />        └─ L2: Legendary Mod Slot\n<br />[/code][/spoiler]\n<br />[color=#00ff00][b]Different ways of crafting and swapping legendary effects[/b][/color]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]The easiest and most natural way of utilising legendary effects is by acquiring legendary items from enemies or other sources. Go to the workbench with them and remove the legendary effect by selecting \"No Legendary Effect\" in the menu. This will add the effect as a loose mod to your inventory. And that loose mod with its effect can be applied to other items you have without any requirement.\n<br />[*]The second and more advanced way is by scrapping legendary items (items which have a legendary mod applied). You'll receive \"Legendary Microchips\" for that process. They can be used to craft any legendary effect the mod has to offer, provided you meet the requirements (amount of Legendary Microchips and perks).\n<br />[*]There's an optional plugin in the \"Expansionsand Patches\" pack/download that adds Microchips to several chests/trunks/safes.\n<br />\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/40650/40650-1587550212-1118533145.png[/img]\n<br />You can configure and customize the mod to your liking. There are two ways to do that directly in-game.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#00ff00]Holotape[/color][/b]\n<br />The holotape gets added to the player's inventory when starting the game for the first time after installing the mod given that you already left Vault 111. It can also be crafted at the Utility Station under the \"Crafting Framework\" section. All the available options have descriptions. Tweak available slots, recipes, inject the new legendary effects into the game's legendary loot pool, tweak microchip returns when scrapping legendaries, etc.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#00ff00]Mod Configuration Menu (optional)[/color][/b]\n<br />This is optional. The MCM configuration becomes available as soon as you install [url=http://f4se.silverlock.org/]Fallout 4 Script Extender (F4SE)[/url] and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/21497]Mod Configuration Menu[/url]. This menu sports exactly the same options as those in the holotape plus two hotkey options that make the \"drop workbench\" items obsolete.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/40650/40650-1595604234-1314529199.png[/img]\n<br />This is a xEdit script that automatically scans your installed mods for crafting recipes and adds them to Crafting Framework's multi-functional workbench. You may patch only a few mods or your entire load order. You'll no longer have a cluttered Chemistry Station with lots of different armour, weapon, ammo or other random recipes. You can even let the script include recipes made for other custom benches, e.g. the ones from AWKCR.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#00ff00]Usage Instructions[/color][/b]\n<br />[list=1]\n<br />[*]Install Crafting Framework, [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/2737]FO4Edit[/url]﻿ and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/68617]MXPF[/url]﻿.\n<br />[*]Download the Workbench Patcher archive on this page and extract its content into your FO4Edit root folder.\n<br />[*]Stay in that folder and run [i]CF_WorkbenchPatcher.bat[/i]. When all required files are in place you can hit Y and Enter to continue.\n<br />[*]In FO4Edit's plugin selection keep your entire load order selected and hit OK.\n<br />[*]Wait for the loading process to be finished and a menu will appear. In this menu, you can hover over the options to get a tooltip with additional information.\n<br />[*]Start the patching process. If that's the first time you're creating a patch the script will ask you for a plugin name.\n<br />[*]Afterwards, you can select the plugins you want to be included in the patch.\n<br />[*]Follow the instructions and wait until the message box says [i]Patching Complete[/i].\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/40650/40650-1595605248-326221847.png[/img]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/articles/1979]FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions[/url]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/articles/1980]Compatibility - Crafting Framework and other Mods in Detail[/url]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/articles/1985]Switching from another legendary crafting mod to Crafting Framework mid-playthrough[/url]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/articles/1981]Guide: Adding Crafting Framework support to custom legendary effects[/url]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/articles/1982]Guide: Adding legendary attachment points to items[/url]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/articles/1983]Guide: Tweak Crafting Framework's slot and recipe visibility independent of savegames or playthroughs[/url]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/articles/2320]Guide: Identifying duplicate recipes from other plugins that interact with Crafting Framework's legendary effects[/url]\n<br />[*]﻿[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/articles/2351]Guide: Adding new workbenches (modes) to the Universal Workbench[/url]\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/40650/40650-1595605252-380620919.png[/img]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/40919]Armor and Clothing Overhaul[/url]: If you want to use CF's functionality with clothing but don't want to use Armorsmith Extended or Unified Clothing Overhaul (UCO) check this out.

Being script-based, DDLL has the benefit of [b]not [/b]requiring specific DLCs and Creations, and [b]not[/b] requiring you to create or used merged patches![/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b]How does it work?\n<br />[/b][size=3]Without going [i]too[/i] technical, when you first load DDLL it will scan through your currently loaded plugins and [b]specifically[/b] look for which DLC and CreationClub plugins are enabled. If supported plugins are found, DDLL will dynamically 'fetch' relevant items, place them in DDLL's own, custom Leveled Lists, and then inject those Leveled Lists throughout the game - much like many popular weapon mods do. Best of all, this means there are [u][b]no[/b][/u] hard requirements - you could even load this mod with no DLCs or CreationClub plugins enabled at all, it just wouldn't do anything.\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[b]Customizing your experience\n<br />[/b][/size][size=3]When DDLL starts up, you'll be shown a message box that lets you tailor DDLL to your preference - namely:\n<br />[/size][list]\n<br />[*][size=2]If you want CreationClub items to inject into your game only [b]after[/b] you complete each Creation's quest (default being no.)[/size]\n<br />[/list][list]\n<br />[*][size=2]What types of Creations you want to inject into your game (See Item Tiers below)[/size]\n<br />[/list][size=3]You can re-open the Customization Menu by crafting the DDLL Customization item from a Chemistry Workbench under the Utilities section.\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[b][size=4]Item Tiers\n<br />[/size][/b][size=3]Every supported CreationClub plugin has been assigned a [b]Tier[/b] - with the Tiers being Standard, Wacky and Unhinged. \n<br />Standard items being non-surprising items in the game (The CR-74L, Anti Materiel rifle etc), Wacky being in-lore but silly items (Zetan Arsenal, Pint-Sized Slasher's knife etc), and Unhinged being non-lore items (BFG 9000, Thunderbolt etc).

            "description": "Requires base game only\n<br />[center][u][b]\n<br />[size=4]Description[/size][/b][/u][/center]\n<br />Raiders wear a greater variety of clothing, are a little tougher, and drop fewer stimpaks. All with base game equipment. \n<br />\n<br />[u][b][center][size=4]Details[/size][/center][/b][/u]\n<br />I added a few SPECIAL points to ClassRaider. In particular 4 points of Endurance, since otherwise raiders don't get any. I also added 15 points of bonus damage resist to ClassRaider. This makes raiders a little more durable without changing their equipment stats.\n<br />\n<br />I edited the leveled lists that determine a raider's underarmor and headgear. Adding some appropriate outfits. They still primarily spawn with vanilla items, but you might see a raider with civilian clothes. Some clothing will not appear until you meet higher level raiders. There should also be fewer raiders with full armor in early game, but more in late game.\n<br />\n<br />I edited the leveled list that determines what items spawn on death. Unchanged you might get brass knuckles or a stimpack. Now you might get 0-5 items. Some low quality food, junk or jet. Mostly junk. This will greatly reduce the number of stimpaks you collect in a game considering how many raiders you typically encounter. However some raiders spawn with stimpaks to use in combat, so you might still find them if you are stealthy or quick to kill them.\n<br />\n<br />1.4 Adds a rare \"raider chemist\" with special gear. They are part of the legendary raider pool (but I don't believe they drop legendary equip) and should show up after level 25. Hard to play test, but should add an appropriate risk/reward factor as well as adding more flavor to raiders.\n<br />I've also updated the mod to AWKCR 6.0+ keywords.\n<br />[center][u][size=4][b]\n<br />Optional/Experimental[/b][/size][/u][/center]\n<br />I added an optional file that is just the LLD_raider leveled list that determines what spawns on raiders when they die. If you just want that, there you go. I also made a duplicate of the main file, only with the change that on spawn, raiders will have different body shapes (exactly like the bodyslide triangle in player gen at the start of the game). Even if it doesn't cause compatibility issues, the results can be a bit off so I'm just putting it out there if people want chunky raiders.\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][b][u][center]Goal[/center][/u][/b][/size]\n<br />I imagine raiders as being desperate and disorganized, yet at the same time hardened by circumstance. Some are settlers or scavengers still wearing whatever they could scrap together, rather than all wearing the same four outfits. They don't have good equipment or medical supplies. Barely scraping by and desperate enough to do anything to get through the next day. Game play wise I just got sick of finding a stimpack on every other dead raider.\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][u][b][center]Compatibility[/center][/b][/u][/size]\n<br />Raider Overhaul changes everything that this does, so they are not compatible. At best you can load my LLD_raider file after and it shouldn't cause problems. I didn't touch weapon or armor lists (other than underarmor and headgear) so mods that give raiders weapons should be fine. Mods that add new raider faces should also be fine. I'm using [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/15780/?]Varied Raiders[/url] and not having issues.\n<br />Version 1.3 and beyond changes stats on two base game gasmasks so that they can be worn with hats/helmets. I will add a compatibility version for AWKCR.",

            "description": "(RUS/ENG)\n<br />\n<br />[b]Описание: [/b]\n<br />Данный мод логическое продолжение [url=https://gamer-mods.ru/go?https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/26286?tab=description]Boston FPS Fix[/url] (сам мод Boston FPS Fix больше не требуется), мне очень понравился этот мод, но к сожалению он исправляет только Бостон. И я решил сделать свой мод который бы смог исправить все ошибки и дать большой + к FPS.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Что он делает?[/b]\n<br />Немногие знают что создатели Fallout 4 при добавлении DLC сломали самостоятельно около 30 ячеек в мире. Сломанные прекомбинации это то что дает нам огромное падение FPS во многих местах и особенно это видно в Бостоне. Данный мод полностью востанавливает ВСЕ ячейки Содружества. Все 4500 ячеек были сгенерированы с нуля.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Какой плюс от использования? [/b]\n<br />У вас будет большой прирост к фпс и абсолютная плавность игрового процесса.\n<br />[b]\n<br />[/b][b]Что требуется? [/b]\n<br />Оригинальный Fallout 4 + all DLC.\n<br />Неофициальный патч \n<br />\n<br />[b]Почему именно так? [/b]\n<br />Потому что DLC вносят изменения в ячейки также как патч в некоторые.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Совместимость: [/b]\n<br />Мод совместим с любыми текстурами:\n<br />[b]\n<br />[/b][b]Несовместимость: [/b]\n<br />Мод частично совместим с модами которые меняют расположение объектов в мире. \n<br />Если мод добавляет объекты а не перемещает стандартные объекты (столы,стулья,шкафы,стены) то он будет работать на 100%.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Патчи:[/b]\n<br />Многие моды потребуют патчи и я собираюсь их сделать со временем.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Порядок загрузки модов: [/b]\n<br />Данный мод следует загружать ПОСЛЕДНИМ ПОСЛЕ ВСЕХ МОДОВ и только так.\n<br />Все моды которые будут загружены ПОСЛЕ отменят воссозданные прекомбинации и сломают FPS в ячейках.\n<br />[b]\n<br />Description:[/b]\n<br />This mod is a logical continuation of[b] [/b][url=https://gamer-mods.ru/go?https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/26286?tab=description]Boston FPS Fix[/url] (the mod Boston FPS Fix is no longer required), I really liked this mod, but unfortunately it only fixes Boston. And I decided to make my own mod that could fix all the mistakes of the developers and give a big boost to FPS.\n<br />[b]\n<br />What does it do?[/b]\n<br />Few people know that the creators of Fallout 4 when adding DLC broke on their own about 30 cells in the world. Broken recombination is what gives us a huge drop in FPS in many places and this is especially evident in Boston. This mod completely restores all cells of the Commonwealth. All 4,500 cells were generated from scratch.\n<br />\n<br />[b]What is the advantage of using it?[/b]\n<br />You will have a large increase in fps and absolute smoothness of the game process.\n<br />\n<br />[b]What is required?[/b]\n<br />Original Fallout 4 + all DLC.\n<br />Unofficial patch\n<br />\n<br />[b]Why so?[/b]\n<br />Because DLC makes changes to cells just like a patch does to some. \n<br />\n<br />[b]Compatibility: [/b]\n<br />The mod is compatible with any textures:\n<br />\n<br />[b]Incompatibility: [/b]\n<br />The mod is partially compatible with mods that change the location of objects in the world. \n<br />If the mod adds objects instead of moving standard objects (tables,chairs,cabinets, walls), it will work 100%.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Patches:[/b]\n<br />Many mods will require patches and I'm going to make them over time.\n<br />[b]\n<br />How to load mods: [/b]\n<br />This mod should be loaded LAST AFTER all MODS and only so.\n<br />All mods that will be loaded AFTER will cancel the recreated recombinations and break the FPS in the cells.",

They now provide a excellent tactical distraction against a group of foot soldiers.\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Frag Grenade/Mine, ...\n<br />[*]Oxygen Tanks, Small Cars, Turret Explosions, ...\n<br />[*]Gauss Impact Explosion\n<br />[*]Power Armor Explosive Vent\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[b]Medium explosions[/b] can also ragdoll [b]Power-Armored NPCs[/b], but not large enemies (Yao-Guais, Behemoths and such). Now those Brotherhood mooks will never dare to disturb you anymore while you chill out with your buddy Danse!\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Missile, Broadsider\n<br />[*]Large Vehicles, Vertibird Crash, ...\n<br />[*]Behemoth Slam and Stomp\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[b]Large explosions[/b] knock [b]all NPCs[/b] down, including those normally immune to staggering. Use these if you really need to loose that Deathclaw that is chasing you for the last ten minutes.\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*](Mini) Nukes, Nuka Grenades, Quantum Thirst Zapper\n<br />[*]Artillery and Homing Beacon (which uses the Fat Man Explosion)\n<br />[/list]\n<br />Energy explosives like Pulse and Plasma Grenades, but also the Molotov, aren't affected by Explosion Knockdown, since they don't seem to exert an excessive force on the victims (for me, at least).\n<br />\n<br />Optionally, you can enable knockdown for the player via MCM, and change whether wearing Power Armor should make the player immune to knockdowns. This is not recommended though since the camera forces to 3rd person on every knockdown, potentially causing problems like stuck camera (at least on my end). You can also turn off the knockdown effect anytime and adjust the knockdown chances of each tier (they're 100% by default).\n<br />\n<br />As in update 1.5, you can turn off friendly fire against non-hostiles (they will respond to your explosion though and turn hostile) and your companions in the MCM.\n<br />\n<br />Watch the videos to get an idea how the mod works in-game!\n<br />\n<br />[b][center][size=4]Compatibility[/size][/center]\n<br />[/b]Conflicts with mods that edits the same explosion records. Mod added explosions also need patching. The base plugin only covers vanilla explosions. Patches for the following mods are included in the FOMOD:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Better Explosion Redux\n<br />[*]Wasteland Imports\n<br />[*]Remote Explosives \n<br />[*]True Frags\n<br />[*]RPG-7V2\n<br />[*]M79 Grenade Launcher standalone\n<br />[/list][u]All plugins are marked as ESL. [/u]\n<br />\n<br />To patch custom explosions yourself, fill the object effect field with one of the knockdown enchantments (or add the knockdown magic effect to the existing enchantment) and fill the Placed Object field with one of the temporary xmarkers.\n<br />\n<br />[center][size=4][b]Known issues[/b][/size][/center]\n<br />None currently. Any bug reports and/or improvement suggestions are welcome! Just leave a note in the corresponding sections and I'll try to answer :)",

            "description": "[color=#f6b26b][font=Courier New][size=5][b]★ About ★[/b][/size][/font][/color]\n<br />\n<br />In the vanilla game, player dialogue requires exactly four response options - the game would not accept any more, nor any less. This system also shoehorned most dialogue into one of four types: Yes, No, Neutral and Question. As you might imagine, dialogue doesn't always fall neatly into these categories!\n<br />\n<br />The [b]Extended Dialogue Interface[/b] ([b]XDI[/b]) is a community framework that removes the hardcoded 4-option limit on dialogue and adds engine support for any number of player dialogue options.\n<br />\n<br />Mods can now create new dialogue experiences that emphasize player choice and have dialogue options that truly reflect their intent.\n<br />\n<br />XDI does not modify vanilla dialogue on its own but will display full-text for vanilla dialogue choices.\n<br />\n<br />Interestingly, in several vanilla scenes, Bethesda themselves have additional dialogue options recorded! In many cases, these are not wired up correctly for XDI (no associated responses, etc.) so they cannot simply be turned on globally. However, it is possible for modders to modify such vanilla dialogue scenes to wire them up correctly and expose additional voiced dialogue lines that are already part of the base game.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f6b26b][font=Courier New][size=5][b]★ Features ★[/b][/size][/font][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*] [b]Full dialogue text[/b]. View your dialogue options with full certainty of what you're going to say.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*] [b]Dialogue cues[/b]. A question icon can be optionally displayed for dialogue options that do not advance the conversation. No more accidentally making a choice  when all you wanted was to get more information. Options that end the conversation will have a door icon displayed beside them.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*] [b]Flexible dialogue options[/b]. Modders: have less than four things to say? Have just two options, Or add as many options as you'd like.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*] [b]No player voice, no problem[/b]. Skyrim and New Vegas didn't have a voiced player either! XDI makes engine modifications to overcome this. For unvoiced player dialogue, NPC dialogue starts right after option selection. The dialogue camera is hot-patched to keep focus on the NPC instead of (in vanilla) looking at the player's unmoving mouth. No more awkward pauses.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*] [b]Configurable via MCM[/b]. XDI comes with a MCM menu for easy configuration.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*] [b]No hacks[/b].

This file is provided in XDI's BA2 archive.

Why is it not in this build?[/color]\n<br />A: Unfortunately, I found that the mod you are talking about, seems to conflict with many mods. It was one of the primary reasons I would CTD. I have used the mod many times and never had a problem with other builds. However, when putting the mod under the microscope there is a problem. Does the author know about the problem? It's either a fatal error leading to CTD or a false flag. Without dissecting the mod, I have noway to know for sure. So, I just removed it. If you really want to use the mod, I recommend you make sure it's at the top of the load order. \n<br />\n<br />[color=#f1c232]Q: Are all the mods listed above required? [/color]\n<br />A: No. The only mods required are the ones that are listed in the requirement section under \"[color=#ff7700]Required Mods and their Load Order[/color]\" You will notice that some of the mods I require are not required by the File Header of my patch. You can remove some mods that are not tied to the file header, but by doing so, some of the edits in my patch are based on using all of my Required Mods. By not using all, you increase your risk of CTD. \n<br />\n<br />[color=#dd7e6b]Q: I loaded your required mods, started a new game and it's just sitting at the load screen.[/color]\n<br />A: Sometimes when using mods and starting a new game, Fallout 4 will sit at the load screen. The screen will be black with the green little icon doing it's business on the bottom right. Hitting enter a couple of times seems to fix this. Not sure why this works, but it seems to be a bug in Vanilla not the mods. \n<br />\n<br />[color=#c27ba0]Q: My favorite mod is not on the list[/color]\n<br />A: I went through all trending files of all time and of the last six months. I removed anything that had critical errors when put under the microscope. Then I removed all mods that had minor errors. Minor errors usually doesn't mean CTD, but, it ups the probability. I was left over with about 300 mods. I kept changing the orders around and found that some mods just don't play nice with others. I removed them and got the list above. \n<br />\n<br />[color=#76a5af][color=#ffe599]Q: I really want to use [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/4472?tab=description]True Storms[/url]. Is there a way?[/color]\n<br />[color=#efefef]A: Yes. You need to use [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/15908?tab=description]Weather Synergy[/url]. Make sure you use VividPriority. Follow their suggested load order and it will work. Giving you the best of both worlds.\n<br />\n<br />Q: [color=#00ffff]Can I use [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/2139]Fr4nsson's Light Tweaks[/url] with this build?[/color]\n<br />A: Yes, just make sure [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/2139]Fr4nsson's Light Tweaks [/url]is loaded before [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/13596]Enhanced Lights and FX[/url].\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffff00]Q: Why are some enemies just heads or invisible?[/color]\n<br />A: Most likely you are using a mod that requires[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/25] Bodyslide[/url] and you didn't build the meshes as required. You can use a search engine to find tutorials on using [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/25]Bodyslide[/url]. \n<br />[/color][color=#e06666]\n<br />Q: I prefer [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/2139]Fr4nsson's Light Tweaks[/url] over [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/13596]Enhanced Lights and FX[/url]. Is there a way to use Fr4nsson's?[/color]\n<br />[color=#efefef]A:. Yes. Load [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/2139]Fr4nsoon's Light Tweaks[/url] after [/color][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/13596][color=#efefef]Enhanced Lights and FX.[/color][/url]\n<br />\n<br />Q: Can I add mods I like[/color]\n<br />A: Sure, but I can't guarantee it will be a stable build then.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#93c47d]Q: What do you mean stable?[/color]\n<br />A: I did a speed run through to see if it crashed constantly. I would return to places that it would crash a lot and find the mods that were responsible. I removed them. I would then do a stress test spawning anything I could to see if it would CTD after awhile. If so, I would try to find the mod that might be responsible and remove it. I would load mods during a save game and see what that did. I would make sure I could at least start the main quests and important side quests. After several months of this and rebuilding the patch, this is what is left over. \n<br />\n<br />[color=#e06666]Q: Is there a certain way to install graphical mods?[/color]\n<br />This usually varies by user but I prefer manual. I don't mind my mods overwriting some hi-rez textures. I would prefer low-rez in certain places and stability, then hi-rez and CTD. To try to get the best performance per look, that's a little trickier.

However, it does not play well with others and should only use the mods that the author created patches for. I highly recommend you do a play through with Horizon. [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/21872]Sim Settlements[/url] because you don't need to use it if you want. You can still build the old fashion way or use many great features Sim Settlements has to offer. \n<br />\n<br />[color=#93c47d]Q: Anything I should know about your build?[/color]\n<br />A: Yes. Some graphical glitches, most likely due to the engine and not the mods. Fallout 4 is prone to CTD in Vanilla. Even knowing this build is for Survival game-play, I still use Quick Save manager. [url=http://enbdev.com/download_mod_fallout4.htm]ENB[/url] settings can be used. I recommend using the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/332]ENB Memory Patch[/url]. How you use [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/4640]Spring Cleaning[/url] can cause some weird graphical glitches. If you are using [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/28599]Rise of the Commonwealth[/url]. I recommend you don't use [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/4640]Spring Cleaning[/url] until after you assign a leader and you don't use it on grass. Just clutter, trees and junk. When downloading a mod that I require, always pick the non script level list version when given a choice. For compatible mods, always pick script level list version when given the choice. \n<br />\n<br />[color=#3d85c6]Q: What is the files in the brackets above?[/color]\n<br />A: Some mods install more than one esp. What's in the brackets is to let you know what other files I used besides the core file. If you don't see the esp above when you install a mod that has multiple plugins, it's because it's not necessary after you use my patch or the other esps had issues, while the core file didn't. \n<br />\n<br />Q:Does [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/12511]Conquest[/url] work with [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/21872]Sim Settlements[/url]?\n<br />A: [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/12511]Conquest[/url] and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/21872]Sim Settlements[/url] can coexist but they don't work together due to how [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/12511]Conquest[/url] is scripted. When using [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/12511]Conquest[/url], you will need to build the settlements the old fashion way. \n<br />\n<br />[color=#dd7e6b]Q: I want to use different settings then you.[/color]\n<br />A: Just rename the esp. For example, Live Action Handy - With GlowMap.esp will need to be renamed to Live Action Handy.esp\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffe599]Q: My settlers keep getting killed, this is BS.[/color] \n<br />A: I think it adds a more immersive gameplay. However, there is a workaround. You are going to need [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/18978]Forcefiled Protection[/url] which is a required mod and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/12390]The God Pistol[/url]﻿. Use the console command, \"help field 4\" and pick the Mark 7 non power armor version. Use the console command again, \"help god 4\", and get the weapon ID number. Then use the \"player.giveitem (id number) 1\" or whatever. You can mod the gun to make it even more powerful. Give your settlers the gun and forcefield. They should be unstoppable then. Don't forget to have your settlers equip the items. \n<br />\n<br />[color=#b4a7d6]Q: What is your computer build so I can better guess what textures and how many mods I should be using?[/color]\n<br />i7-2700k 3.5GHZ\n<br />32GB of Ram\n<br />Nvidia Geforce GTX 1070\n<br />Windows 10\n<br />Game is installed on a WD 10k RPM Raptor Drive\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffe599]Q: Will you be adding more mods and other patches?[/color]\n<br />A: Yes, working on another one as we speak\n<br />\n<br />[color=#e06666]Q: I've done everything you asked. Download all the mods. Have the load order similar to yours. Used you patch and still constant CTD. [/color]\n<br />A: That sucks. I don't mean to be callous but there are so many reasons for this. Your graphics setting are too high. One of the graphical packs you installed had a bad install, texture, mesh, etc... Something  that you are running in the background like a virus protection program is eating up all your memory. Or, and you know it's coming, you are using another mod that is not on the list, hell bent on using it and it's not playing well with the others but don't want to tell me, hoping I will problem solve it for you. \n<br />\n<br />[color=#b4a7d6]Q: I have a super computer! How dare you mention the above, like my graphics settings are too high. [/color]\n<br />A: Maybe your computer doesn't like me and doesn't want my patch to work on your computer. I would recommend you have a talk with your computer and get to the bottom of it! \n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ff00]Q: No, I swear, I have done everything you asked and still constant CTD. [/color]\n<br />A: When using ESP and ESM, the game can only handle 256 mods. If you installed every mod that you could that is compatible with this patch, you might have exceeded your limit. If that is not the case, try to load without my patch and see if that helps. If yes, then your load order is messed up or you just got a bad download. Re-download the patch. If none of that helped, most likely you forgot to add something to your INI file as requested by this mod and others, or you forgot to download something that is required by the mods above.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ffff]Q: Still getting CTD is there anything else I can do?[/color]\n<br />A: Yes, it's a tedious process but the best process to get rid CTD's for good, or severely limit them. You will need [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/2737]F04Edit[/url] and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/38413]The Manual[/url]. It's an older manual but the rules still apply. So, it will be helpful. You are going to clean every mod. How to clean mods is described in the manual. This must be done one by one and the last mod on the list is the one you are always cleaning. Meaning, you need to actually load each mod one by one and clean them. \n<br />\n<br />For example, you would load the game, the DLC then Mod 1. Clean mod 1, save and move on. Load the game, DLC, Mod 1 and Mod 2. Clean mod 2, save and move one. Keep doing this until all your mods have been cleaned. DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT load all your mods and then clean them all in one session. This will just create more CTD and ruin your build. \n<br />\n<br />After all this, if you are still experiencing high CTD. You just have a bad build. You can check mods for errors. Once again, the manual explains how. All problematic mods should be removed. To clean DLC or not to clean DLC, that is the question. This is personal preference. I never have, but some people swear it helps stabilize the game. Make sure you follow someone's load order or you have [url=https://boss-developers.github.io/]BOSS[/url] or [url=https://loot.github.io/]LOOT[/url] do your load order for you. Not having the right load order is one of the biggest culprits for CTD.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#cc4125]Q: Help, I removed mods and added some others and now my save game is bugging out.\n<br />[/color]Fallout 4 seems to be the worse Bethesda game when it comes to changing or even upgrading mods with a current save game. It's extremely annoying but you have two options. Open the Sim Settlement management screen. Go to Tools --&gt; Configuration Tools and then click on Rebuild Local Data. This will reset your mod scripts. After three in game days, you game has a good chance of no longer bugging out. If that doesn't work. \n<br />\n<br />If you know which mod(s) might be bugging out. Remove said mods, enter you game, move to a new location. Save. Remove and reinstall the problematic mods. Load your game, move to a new location and save. After three in game days, you game might not bug out anymore.",

It works with Skyrim Special Edition, Skyrim Legendary Edition, Skyrim Legendary Edition + Crash Fixes, and Fallout 4.\n<br />\n<br />There are already two Very Good savegame editors out there; Save Game Script Cleaner (aka SaveTool), and Savegame Script Scalpel. I use them both and they are fantastic. They do have their problems though. Script Scalpel has a difficult UI and is a bit slow. SaveTool has quite limited filtering options. And at the time I'm writing this, neither of them can load savegames from Skyrim Special Edition or that use the new file format introduced in Crash Fixes 10. And they can't handle Fallout 4. ReSaver is intended to correct those problems while adding useful new features for cleaning saves.\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]Features[/size][b]\n<br />[/b][list]\n<br />[*]Reads and writes Skyrim SE, Skyrim LE, and Fallout 4 savefiles\n<br />[*]Reads and writes the new Crash Fixes savegame file format\n<br />[*]Displays a TONS of useful information\n<br />[*]Edits script data\n<br />[*]Terminates threads (right-click on an ActiveScript and pick \"Terminate\")\n<br />[/list][i]Mod Parsing[/i]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Reads your ESM/ESP/PEX/BSA files looking for information that will help\n<br />[*]identify which parts of the savegame are the ones that you're looking.\n<br />[*]Just pick \"Parse\" from the File menu.\n<br />[*]Works best if you use Mod Organizer.\n<br />[/list][i]Filtering\n<br />[/i][list]\n<br />[*]Filter using regex (regular expressions)\n<br />[*]Filter by plugin (right-click on a plugin)\n<br />[*]Filter by mod (right-click on a plugin)\n<br />[*]Filter to show what would be deleted by each cleaning operation\n<br />[/list][i]Cleaning[/i]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Deletes unattached script instances (in the \"Clean\" menu)\n<br />[*]Deletes undefined elements (in the \"Clean\" menu)\n<br />[*]Cleans formlists\n<br />[*]Deletes plugin data\n<br />[/list][i]Not yet implemented[/i]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Exporting and importing savegame data\n<br />[*]Cleaning of Havok data\n<br />[*]Filtering scripts with invalid data\n<br />[*]Analyzing mods managed by Nexus Mod Manager or Wrye Bash\n<br />[/list]\n<br />ReSaver is quite stable and I use it myself.

It's possible that it will ruin your savefile, hard drive, childhood, and kidneys.

            "description": "[size=3]I highly recommend using this towards end game or game saves in which you have been playing a long long time or on survival play through to help combat save bloat. \n<br />\n<br />Q: What is save bloat?\n<br />A: In open world games were everything is moveable the game needs to create a record of that move. For example your in a fire fight and you miss and hit a beer bottle sending it flying. The game with then keep a record where that bottle landed so the next time you enter that cell it will still be there that record is save until there is a cell reset. Every time you build something in your settlement it keeps a record of that. ANNNNDDDD every time you kill something it keeps a record of that. F04 has built in scrubbers to remove dead bodies and cell change records after a period of time. Default is 24 ingame hours for bodies and Cells (world spaces) for non survival is 7 in day games survival is 80 I believe. \n<br />As the f04 builds records of all your activities the save file gets larger and larger.  If you have modified time scale and respawn/cell reset mods, save times get even larger.  I use Zombie Walkers mod which is always spawning zombies, (or if you use fo4 76 mod) you will end up with alot of dead bodies quickly resulting in long save time + 3-5 minutes per save. With this activated my save time drops down to under 5 seconds. \n<br />\n<br />My current save is 2400 hours survival with large settlement builds time scale at 10 and zombie mods, ﻿with this activated my save time drops to under 5 seconds for hard saves.  The only downside is to make sure you loot bodies right away.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />This mod is light weight and only changes the iHoursToClearCorpses from 24 hours to 1. \n<br />\n<br />How to use, Install with nmm or Manual install. I suggest dropping it at the bottom of the load order to fight dirty edits. Activate it. Go to a interior cell wait 2 hours then save. When you return to cells that you have previously had engaged in combat and left piles of dead bodies they will now be gone.   \n<br />\n<br />For the change to be effective you must leave the cell wait 2  in Game Hours. If you return before 1 ingame hour is up, fo4 will reset the timer and the bodies will remain.\n<br />\n<br />I included a txt/bat file in the zip archive for people not wanting to increase there mod list. \n<br />\n<br />Drop the .txt file into your main fo4 directory (not your data directory) start the game open the console type Bat corpse it will activate. You should only need to run it once for a play through. However if it does rest on you just run the bat again.  \n<br />\n<br />To check type ﻿﻿getgs ihourstoclearcorpses and it will show you the value.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br /> [/size][size=6]Links to GHOST FC3S's other projects[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/36006]Ammo boxes to mags[/url]﻿[/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/36006][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/thumbnails/36006/36006-1542686556-569258488.jpeg[/img][/url]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/35712]RU556 Armoury Project\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/thumbnails/35712/35712-1541624148-1458128811.jpeg[/img]﻿\n<br />\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/33088]No main quest - Wasteland Operator mod[/url]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/33088][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/thumbnails/33088/33088-1531035112-736160208.jpeg[/img]\n<br />[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/30927]Galac-Tac\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/thumbnails/30927/30927-1522788284-769146834.jpeg[/img]﻿\n<br />\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/27244]Minuteman's Last Stand\n<br />[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/27244][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/thumbnails/27244-0-1507655660.jpg[/img][/url]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/18639]Subway Runner[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/18639]\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/thumbnails/18639-2-1474432422.jpg[/img]\n<br />\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/16476]Kerberos Panzer Cop Jin Roh The wolf\n<br />\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/16476][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/thumbnails/16476-4-1469059341.jpg[/img][/url]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/31605]FROST Craftable Liquor with VALDACIL tag[/url]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/31605][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/thumbnails/31605/31605-1525698743-1898567590.jpeg[/img][/url][size=3]\n<br />\n<br />[/size]",

            "description": "[size=6][color=#f1c232]Faster Workshop[/color][/size]\n<br />\n<br />Faster Workshop is an F4SE plugin that optimizes workshop loading times by replacing some of the most expensive and inefficient regions of workshop loading code with far more efficient versions.\n<br />\n<br />On top of this, it also does two more things:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Provides a hotkey to instantly enter Workshop mode.\n<br />[*]Fixes the issue with workshop icons not loading when navigating through them quickly.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />Testers with a current workshop load time of ~15s (from activating a Workshop to having the build menu appear) report a drop in load time to less than half a second. Those with a lower starting load time report near-instantaneous Workshop loads with the plugin installed.\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][color=#f1c232]About[/color][/size]\n<br />\n<br />As you acquire more mods that add content to your game, you may have noticed the game freezing up (video freezes and you cannot move) for increasingly longer periods of time when you attempt to start Workshop mode. Even when these mods have nothing to do with the Workshop!\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][i]What's going on?[/i][/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[spoiler]It boils down to the game using some incredibly inefficient code to figure out what objects you can build in workshop mode. Whenever you start Workshop mode, the game evaluates the conditions on [b]every single constructible object in the game[/b] to find out if they belong in the workshop - this includes even non-workshop items like weapon mods and chems. And it does that not just once (!), but repeats this loop for [b]each and every workshop submenu you have[/b]!\n<br />\n<br />If you install a mod that adds two new submenus to your workshop, one would reasonably expect to incur just a small overhead of a couple of additional checks. Instead, in reality, this causes two more loops through every single craftable object in the game.\n<br />\n<br />As you install more mods that add any kind of craftable object to the game, entering the workshop will inevitably and perhaps noticeably slow down, even if these objects have nothing to do with the workshop.\n<br />\n<br />And to make it all worse, every time you exit the workshop, the game tears down all this data it worked so hard to build and starts over![/spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][color=#f1c232]Do I need this mod?[/color][/size]\n<br />\n<br />When you start workshop mode, is there any noticeable delay before the build menu appears? If so, this mod can help.\n<br />\n<br />If you do not currently experience any lag when starting Workshop mode, congratulations! You have a beefy-enough rig, or do not have many (workshop) mods installed. But do keep this mod in mind in case you need it in the future. The rate of load time increase is [b]not linear[/b] in the number of mods you have installed - it is far worse, so you may see load times shoot up quickly if you install certain kinds of mods. (see About section for more detailed information)\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][color=#f1c232]How it works (technical)[/color][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[spoiler]This F4SE plugin rewrites code that handles workshop object loading. On the first workshop load of the game session, the plugin goes through the constructible objects once and maps keywords to their constructible objects. Now, instead of looping through the entire COBJ list every time a mapping of COBJ to KWYD is needed, it is a constant-time operation to look up this information from the prebuilt map. Conditions will now only be evaluated on COBJs that belong in the workshop category, instead of all loaded COBJs.[/spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][color=#f1c232]Installation[/color][/size]\n<br />\n<br />Install with your preferred mod manager, or copy the files in the download to your Fallout 4 Data folder.\n<br />Make sure that you start the game with the F4SE loader, otherwise F4SE will not be active.\n<br />\n<br />This is an in-memory code patch. It does not attach any scripts to objects or your save and is safe to install or remove at any time.\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][color=#f1c232]Requirements[/color][/size]\n<br />\n<br />Fallout 4 game version 1.10.50 or higher.\n<br />[url=http://f4se.silverlock.org/]Fallout 4 Script Extender (F4SE)[/url], 0.6.4 or higher.\n<br />The [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/21497/]Mod Configuration Menu[/url], if you want to assign a hotkey for starting Workshop mode. Not necessary otherwise.\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][color=#f1c232]Acknowledgements[/color][/size]\n<br />\n<br />Many thanks to the xSE team, for F4SE.",

When NPCs run away they zip away at ridiculous speed so I added a slowing effect (curable if the NPC uses a Stimpak) and debuffed their action points for 30 sec so they can't sprint (cannot stimpak out of the action point debuff). Molotovs work the same as vanilla on anyone in power armor because well, it's power armor![color=#00ffff][u][b] All of these new features to fire have no effect on the player[/b][/u];[/color] we're already smart (or dumb) enough to panic when we are on fire. \n<br />\n<br />In order to make this cool version work and make NPCs reliably drop their gun, I made it so humans and civilized ghouls can no longer use crippled limbs. It's awesome. \n<br />[color=#00ffff][u][b]Note: you the player are still susceptible to limb crippling from gunfire or anything else that hits you, including fire, you are just immune to the artificial limb crippling added to fire effects.[/b][/u][/color]\n<br />If you like crippling enemies but you prefer to be immune to crippling you can either wait until you level up and get the Adamantium Skeleton perk or you download the optional Player Immune to Cripple file.\n<br />\n<br />In order to make crippled limbs unusable I had to edit a HumanRace and GhoulRace value. I have no idea if this will conflict with any anime chick body overhaul cartoon cheerleader boob physics mods you're using but if it does I have a suck version available:\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff0000][b][u]Version 2 (suck version):\n<br />[/u][/b][/color]This version does almost all the same things except instead of enabling unusable crippled limbs and crippling the arm it simply disarms the victim and applies a fear effect to make them run (there's also a fear effect in version 1 for good measure but it's probably redundant with a crippled arm). The downside to this is enemies will very often just pick the weapon right back up or go grab another weapon near their new location after running away. Also sometimes they just don't even run.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff7700][u][b]Possibly weird behavior:[/b][/u][color=#000000] \n<br />[/color][/color]In order to make NPCs reliably run away I added an effect that actually heals crippled legs. Otherwise the molotov has a chance of crippling their legs and they just sit on the floor staring at you while they roast and it looks dumb. So if you cripple a leg and then decide to set them on fire, this is why they are able to magically run again.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff7700][b][u]Other weird behavior:[/u][/b][/color]\n<br />Honestly this mod is just changing NPCs from displaying reeeeeally weird behavior to less weird behavior. I don't think it would take much imagination to make something better and I hope someone does. I would love to see NPCs on fire truly freaking out and and flailing or trying to protect their face but I have no idea how to do that and I have no plans of ever learning how to animate stuff.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff0000][b][u]Conflicts:[/u][/b][/color]\n<br />If you use CROSS Crit Gore overhaul just put this mod somewhere [s]above[/s] below CROSS Crit in your load order. Thanks [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/users/11355265]DerekUGA[/url].\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ff00][b][u]Installing:[/u][/b][/color]\n<br />Just install as usual with Nexus Mod Manager\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ff00][u][b]Uninstalling:[/b][/u][/color]\n<br />Just uninstall as usual with Nexus Mod Manager. There shouldn't be any residual effects at all. This mod just adds a few tweaked \"spell\" effects alongside vanilla fire damage over time spells.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffff00][u]Requirements:[/u][/color]\n<br />Not really a requirement but I highly recommend using this with some damage overhaul or realism mods such as unbogus health scaling and MADNESS to make the NPC's fire-to-death time feel satisfying and believable.\n<br />DLC and non-DLC version available.\n<br />[color=#00ffff][b][u]\n<br />Getting your hott pervy mods to work with version 1.1:[/u][/b][/color]\n<br />You'll have to google some mod conflict manager software or just open your body mod in the Creation Kit and remove the checkbox in HumanRace and GhoulRace that says they're allowed to use crippled limbs.

I&#39;ve dabbled in modding privately in past games, but this game has been my first foray on the scale that I have done. Your support and critiques kept me coming back and helped make this better (all 700+ endorsers, 13K+ downloaders, and 140+ comments).\r<br />\r<br />Right now, due to work commitments and other personal developments, I am officially done with supporting this project. I don&#39;t have the bandwidth to do it justice. As of now (10/21/16), this project is 100% open-source to anyone who wants to take it and roll with it. Keep it going or change it up - that can be up to you. If you&#39;ve enjoyed using this as much as I have, I hope you consider making it your own.\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;ve said it before and I&#39;ll say it again - BIG thank you to [url=https://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/user/65149-cooleo/]cooleo[/url]. He kept this thing going while I&#39;ve been MIA. He pushed out a lot of refinements that I never thought of and for that we&#39;re all grateful. Can&#39;t wait to see what you crank out, dude&#33;[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#efefef][i]Ever want an automatic .50 pistol that shoots plasma rounds? \r<br />5.56mm Hunting Rifle with cryo rounds? \r<br />5mm Submachine Gun with armor piercing rounds?\r<br />Well, this is the mod for you&#33;\r<br />[/i][/color][color=#00ffff]\r<br />[u]SOME BACKGROUND\r<br />\r<br />[/u][/color][/size][size=3]I started out modding Fallout 4 with a little project called [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/3480/?]Caliber Conversion Kit[/url] that sought to add multiple receiver options to swap out ammo types. Even after I completed that project and moved onto other things, I still felt like there was more to do in terms of overhauling the existing weapon mod framework. \r<br />\r<br />Thus, Gunsmith Extended was born. ([b]NOT[/b] affiliated with the Weaponsmith Extended mod).\r<br />\r<br />This mod does a deep dive series of changes to the existing modifications for ballistic firearms as pertains to receivers, fire modes, ammo types, and calibers. I drew on the things I learned working on my other mods to hopefully help diversify the options available when using vanilla weapons.\r<br />\r<br />I hope you enjoy using it as much as I enjoyed making it&#33; Cheers&#33; :-)\r<br />\r<br />[/size][size=3][color=#00ffff][b][u]MOD DETAILS[/u][/b][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[size=3]Adds three (3) new modification categories to supported weapons at the workbench: [color=#00ffff]Fire Mode, Ammo Type, and Caliber[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00ffff]*Fir[/color][/size][color=#00ffff]e Mode[/color]: Switch supported firearms between automatic & semi-automatic. &#39;Nuff said.\r<br />[size=3][color=#00ffff]Ammo Type[/color]: A cocktail of conventional and quirky ammo effects relevant to the Fallout universe\r<br />[color=#00ffff]Caliber[/color]: Switch which type of ammunition your peacemaker uses&#33; Stats will change relative to the type of bullet.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00ffff]*Automatic Receiver changes[/color]: the existing &#34;Automatic Receivers&#34; have been converted to be &#34;Light Bolt Receivers&#34; that increase the rate of fire values.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00ffff]Lever Action Rifle changes[/color]: In addition to adding caliber swaps and ammo types, the lever action rifle also now receives +3 ammo capacity when using the Long Barrel or Long Ported Barrel options [i](they have longer tubes... why not use them?)[/i]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#00ffff]All vanilla and Far Harbor firearms are supported as of version 1&#33;[/color] Note that not all categories are available for every gun (for example, there is no automatic fire mode for the flare gun or double barrel shotgun since it doesn&#39;t make sense). \r<br />\r<br />[color=#00ffff]New caliber/fire mode combinations will spawn from enemies and be sold by vendors&#33;\r<br />[/color][/size][/size][/center][center][size=3][color=#ff0000]If you encounter any issues or crashes, DO NOT post to the comments.

HUDFramework solves this by dynamically loading individual interface mods into the HUD at runtime. It gives modders the tools to load custom widgets and communicate with their widgets.\r<br />\r<br />Note that you need to have a mod installed that uses the framework to see any widgets&#33; If you&#39;re looking for HUDFramework mods to install, there&#39;s a list on the sticky in the Comments section.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#f6b26b][font=Courier New][size=5][b]★ INSTALLATION ★[/b][/size][/font][/color]\r<br />\r<br />1. Install with your preferred mod manager, or copy the files in the download to your Fallout 4 Data folder.\r<br />2. Activate HUDFramework.esm in your mod manager, or via the Mods menu.\r<br />\r<br />Note: If you receive a message about overwriting HUDMenu.swf, then you have an existing UI mod installed. To use both together, you can inject HUDFramework into the other mod using the HUDFramework auto-patcher.

If you have a decent rig but use massive mods like \"Sim Settlements\" that add their own clutter, this mod can help, especially once your settlements upgrade. \n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#b6d7a8]Q:[/color][/b] [color=#fce5cd]Does this mess up the new \"Weapon Debris\" feature added for [b]NVIDIA (PhysX/FleX)[/b] users in patch 1.3.x?[/color]\n<br />[color=#b6d7a8][b]A:[/b][/color] Absolutely not.

It's actually [url=http://www.creationkit.com/Grass]GRASS[/url] that's generated on the fly using [url=http://i.imgur.com/1HGfDY0.jpg]PARAMETERS[/url][url=http://i.imgur.com/tLekmPt.jpg] [/url]initialized when you launch the game. I'm essentially removing 1/4 of all the grass you don't see to try and net older systems a few additional FPS. \n<br />\n<br />You won't CTD because I didn't break precombines, swap any meshes or delete any references. Even if another mod uses junk I removed, the engine will still have all the necessary information to attempt to draw that junk at a density of 0. \n<br />\n<br />In the eyes of the engine it's all just grass to be processed, but to our human eyes it's grass mixed with a ton of insignificant objects. Objects that will no longer exist once you activate this esp.[/font]",

Tend to appear \r<br />during the night in a place you shouldn&#39;t be?\r<br />* Feel like you should be able to get the jump on people? \r<br />* Fancy abducting your friends and making them walk all the way back \r<br />home? \r<br />* Could benefit from being able to throw grenades in one place only to \r<br />have them explode in another place?\r<br />* Want to make a real big mess?\r<br />* Or do you just want to steal everything in sight?\r<br />\r<br />If you answered yes to any of these questions, the Institute has the \r<br />versatile tool for you&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[u][b]The Who What When Where and Why[/b][/u]\r<br />\r<br />Deep within an ice chest in a meat freezer, there is a cancer, known as \r<br />the Portal Gun...\r<br />With each shot, the Institute Portal Gun conjures up one of two \r<br />entangled mystical, magical portals&#33;\r<br />\r<br />One is blue. The other? Orange.\r<br /> \r<br />Use this gun to ascend to new heights, perform daring raids, and annoy \r<br />settlers in endless loops.\r<br />If you can figure out how to solve puzzles or perform testing with it in\r<br /> this game, well, good for you.\r<br />\r<br />Here&#39;s how it works:\r<br />\r<br />Shoot one portal onto some object or surface, step close to it, and be \r<br />warped to the other portal.\r<br />Teleportation works between and within interiors, large exterior places,\r<br /> and in the Commonwealth at large.\r<br />\r<br />But be careful: watch where you warp&#33; \r<br />And it&#39;s not just you who can be transferred to the other side...\r<br />\r<br />Change portal colors by unequipping and reequipping the gun.\r<br />\r<br />Here&#39;s where you can find it:\r<br />\r<br />The Institute has wisely sequestered this awesome power in a place few \r<br />would think to look: its agents have secreted the gun and a special \r<br />holotape in Diamond City, in an ice machine which is itself in the Meat \r<br />Freezer atop Choice Chops&#33; \r<br />\r<br />Also from The Institute labs: Project Holdall, your holotape uplink to \r<br />convenient temporary remote storage of items in the Cloud (of radiation,\r<br /> that is).\r<br />\r<br />Equip the Portal Gun with the Loot Coprocessor to gain even more \r<br />irresponsible power: the power of taking everything in sight for later \r<br />retrieval at your convenience.\r<br />\r<br />In a word: &#34;Emergent&#34; gameplay&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[u][b]Manual type stuff:[/b][/u]\r<br />\r<br />[i]Installation[/i]\r<br />\r<br />No special instructions, archive contains 1 ESP and 2 BA2s.\r<br />Prior to uninstalling, make sure you clear out the remote inventory.\r<br />Its world location is next to the icebox where you get the gun.\r<br />\r<br />[i]Where is this thing specifically?[/i]\r<br />\r<br />For more specific guidance, when you first enter the middle of Diamond City (not the Stands),on the right is the All Faiths Chapel, and next to it is the butcher stand (Choice Chops).  If you&#39;ve got to the front door of the Dugout Inn you&#39;ve gone too far. You want to get on the roof of Choice Chops to access its meat locker (one way is to not completely go up to the stands and walk along the edge of the stadium seating). In \r<br />the Meat Locker is the ice container with the portal gun.  This is a small room with hanging meat and frost, so it&#39;s pretty distinctive once \r<br />you are inside.\r<br />\r<br />[i]How do I change portal colors?[/i]\r<br />\r<br />If you unequip and then re-equip the portal gun ([b]through the menu only[/b]) the colors on the gun should change. When it&#39;s blue, you should be able to fire a blue portal. Do the same to switch back to orange. Sometimes when a save loads, the right color mod\r<br /> might not be equipped; you should also be able to get back in proper phase by this same equipping and un-equipping.\r<br />\r<br />A melee bash (Alt) will also do this: this is the preferred method since it minimizes out-of-color-change phase cosmetic issues.\r<br />\r<br />As an easter egg, if you have a item in the world grabbed, then bash, if you release the grab it will throw the item out in front of you instead of just dropping.\r<br />\r<br />[i]General Cautions[/i]\r<br />\r<br />* If you use the remote storage, clear it out before you uninstall&#33;\r<br />* Dying, getting stuck, breaking NPC behaviors when you displace things, losing things is (WC4:) The Price of Freedom.  \r<br />\r<br />Some notes on buggy behavior and engine limitations:\r<br />\r<br />[i]Fast Travel and Jump[/i] / &#34;Falling&#34; Animation\r<br />\r<br />This glitchy behavior has been around for some time in the Havok enabled Gamebryo games...\r<br />\r<br />From time to time, a warp which results in an incomplete fall animation \r<br />will stick the player temporarily with a falling state. If you want to \r<br />fast travel or jump, these are things you cannot do while the game \r<br />thinks you are falling; another telltale sign is that the character may \r<br />also amusingly hold their hands up when interacting. This problem can \r<br />more rarely happen in the vanilla game in any situation in which you \r<br />fall abruptly or are ragdolled severely. Usually this issue is solved \r<br />pretty handily with this mod by using the Portal Gun to precipitate one \r<br />or two more falls to clear the &#34;floating walk&#34; state. Sometimes menu or \r<br />area transitions or ground cover also resolves this issue.\r<br />\r<br />[i]Controls[/i]\r<br />\r<br />You switch portal types by equipping and reequipping the gun. This is \r<br />admittedly inconvenient: if there was a sensible way in native scripting\r<br /> to capture melee attacks or capture other keystrokes this would have \r<br />been ideal. It may be more convenient for the moment to assign the gun \r<br />and another weapon to quick keys to accelerate this process.\r<br />\r<br />I have looked into multiple ways of doing this. If you come up with something\r<br />particularly crafty, let me know. Otherwise, I plan to put a version of this out\r<br />for the Script Extender at some point, which should make this more convenient.\r<br />\r<br />And yes, something like ammo-type switch (a player-initiated event tied to the gun,\r<br /> but triggered before the weapon firing) would have been \r<br />quite nice&#33; A way to capture a weapon bash event, as pointed out below, \r<br />would also work.  It turns out that swapping an object/weapon mod on a \r<br />gun requires an unequip-reequip cycle anyway. It&#39;s nice, for example, \r<br />that you can detect if the player is sneaking slightly after the portal \r<br />is opened, but this doesn&#39;t let you perform an action upon the player \r<br />sneaking. There are a handful of other approaches, with their own \r<br />issues. It would do good things for weapon mods not requiring script extenders \r<br />if Bethesda patched an alternate fire mode switching mechanism in at \r<br />some point.\r<br />\r<br />[i]Assets: Nostalgia Deficiency&#33;[/i]\r<br />\r<br />Now, to address the elephant in the room, if anyone does come up with a nice, \r<br />well-rigged, nicely textured mesh to approximate the original gun \r<br />from Portal, I would be happy to help realize a version of this mod \r<br />which uses the attractive and nostalgic assets. I don&#39;t have the expertise or the proper\r<br />tools for the time being to give you all the best run at this, so veteran weapon mesh artists, animators, and NIF configurers\r<br />may be interested in bringing the Portal gun and the authentic portal effects to life.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Community Videos[/b]\r<br />\r<br />A good feature overview comes from user &#34;[url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW6yg9hSuAVZMeT_kMMFxwg]Total SideQuest[/url]&#34;\r<br />[youtube]1W9tSrP9J-Y[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />And if you want visual guidance, there&#39;s this from [url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX86tbjTYYFne8z1XnbD2ug]EpicCRAZY WOLF[/url]: \r<br />[youtube]q23n4LjAVTc[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />Thanks to everyone who makes videos with these mods.\r<br />\r<br />And, finally, hope you all have fun with this.",

            "description": "This mod adjusts raiders level, to allow them to use different weapons throughout the progress of the game.\n<br />\n<br />Raiders level is increased, and their health value is manually adjusted to not make them overpowered. The result is: They use a larger variety of weapons.\n<br />\n<br />At level 1, raiders use level 1 weapons. But while the player character levels up, the weaponry of the raiders starts being more varied.\n<br />\n<br />Also, the raiders health is increased a bit when the player levels up.\n<br />\n<br />Raider: Vanilla level 1 (health 30) &gt;&gt;&gt; Modded level 1-10 (health 30-75)\n<br />Raider Scum: Vanilla level 4 (health 45) &gt;&gt;&gt; Modded level 5-15 (health 45-75)\n<br />Raider Psycho: Vanilla level 9 (health 70) &gt;&gt;&gt; Modded level 10-20 (health 70-120)\n<br />Raider Scavver: Vanilla level 14 (health 125) &gt;&gt;&gt; Modded level 15-25 (health 125-175)\n<br />Raider Waster: Vanilla level 21 (health 175) &gt;&gt;&gt; Modded level 25-35 (health 175-225)\n<br />Raider bosses[b]*[/b]: Vanilla level 10 (health 85) &gt;&gt;&gt; Modded level 25-35 (health 85-135)\n<br />Raider Survivalist and Raider Veteran: No modfied (they have levels 30 and 39 in vanilla)\n<br />\n<br />[b]*[/b][size=1](\"Raider bosses\" includes unique named raiders, but unique raiders have their own bonuses, and this is not modified by this mod.)[/size]\n<br />\n<br />As you can see, raiders will have a bit higher health value, but only when the player character has a higher level.\n<br />\n<br />In vanilla, basic raiders have pipe weapons and double barrel shotguns (and melee weapons). With this mod, basic raiders also can have 10mm pistols and hunting rifles, but only when the player character has a higher level. Other types of raiders get [b][u]larger[/u][/b] variety of weapons.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][b]Compatbility[/b][/size]\n<br />\n<br />This mod makes raiders have higher level weapons from the \"raiders weapons list\", but this mod doesn't modify this list. It is compatible with mods that modify weapons and leveled lists, but it may be not compatible with mods that modify raiders characters stats.\n<br />\n<br />This mod is fully compatible with Varied Raiders.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3]Miscellaneous things[/size]\n<br />[/b]\n<br />If you install this mod mid game, I recommend to wait more than 20 days in a inner cell (all respawnable things will be respawned).\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[font=Georgia][size=4][i]Would you like to know more?\n<br />[/i][/size][/font]\n<br />In a modded playthrough, with weapons added lo leveled lists, a higher levels means: Raiders will use many different weapons, specially at high levels. But it depends on what weapon mods you are using.\n<br />\n<br />Also, this mod can be used as a part of [b]Redistribute Weapon Lists - Pipe guns removed[/b] (only if you don't like pipe weapons).\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/44724/]https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/44724/[/url]\n<br />Used this way, raiders and you will enjoy every battle.

            "description": "[size=2]Next Version\n<br /> - Option to auto loot food and drink items.\n<br /> - Option for keeping highlights more persistent.\n<br /> - Experimental pulsing highlights.\n<br /> - System for simple compatibility patches.\n<br /> - Detect mines and some types of traps.\n<br />\n<br />Version 3800 - 6/7/2018\n<br /> - Autoloot should properly trigger OnActivation events.\n<br /> - Improved mod startup/reboot time.\n<br />\n<br />[b]DESCRIPTION[/b]\n<br />This mod will highlight corpses, ash/goo piles, unassigned settlers and objects, broken or unpowered objects, friendlies when scoped, creatures sleeping or unconscious, containers, terminals, collectibles, keys, holos, books, plants, doors, weapons, ammo, caps, chems, legendary items.. and even synth infiltrators.  This mod is highly configurable including settings for when and what to highlight, when to unhighlight, and the color of each highlight.\n<br />\n<br />The mod activates once you take the Scrapper perk, or you manually start it via MCM or holotape.\n<br />\n<br />[b]FOR XBOX ONE VERSION [url=https://bethesda.net/en/mods/fallout4/mod-detail/4059313]CLICK HERE[/url][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b]SETTLEMENTS &amp; OWNERSHIP\n<br />[/b]The mod detects when you are in a settlement or an interior location that you own and disables container and item highlights automatically.  No reason to loot something that is already yours.  Out in the world, common loose items will not highlight if taking them would be stealing, but containers will still highlight so that you can examine their contents.\n<br />\n<br />[b]COMPONENT TRACKING[/b]\n<br />In the vanilla game Scrapper rank 2 highlights objects (like junk) that contain components you tag.  You can tag components in the crafting interface and in the pipboy inventory.  This mod provides an alternative to this feature, so you can customize how junk is highlighted.  It also allows you to tag components from the MCM.  If you are not using F4SE customization of this feature is limited.\n<br />\n<br />This feature will highlight objects in the world containing the components you select, and will also include those objects in inventory searches (highlighting corpses and containers).  The mod remembers encountered items and becomes more accurate and responsive over time.\n<br />\n<br />[b]SEMI-AUTOMATIC LOOTING[/b]\n<br />Common sundries such as ammo, chems, caps, bobbypins, as well as tracked junk can be auto-looted.  Junk will be sent to your last visited workshop, while ammo etc. is given to the player when the pipboy is opened.  Non-legendary weapons can be auto-looted and converted immediately to caps.  Quest items are not autolooted and this feature will not take an item if it would count as stealing.  Also survival needs like meats and plants will not be autolooted.\n<br />\n<br />Autolooting is only active while highlights are active.\n<br />\n<br />Normally autoloot triggers on proximity.  But if an exploded corpse is strewn across the battlefield and you can't find the \"center\" of it just pick up a chunk of that supermutant or whatever it used to be and autoloot will trigger.\n<br />\n<br />[b]DYNAMIC MOD WEAPON SUPPORT[/b]\n<br />New weapons and ammo added by mods can be highlighted and autolooted too.  The first time you equip a new weapon from a mod Loot Detector will ask you to confirm adding it to the detection list.  Default ammo for the weapon will automatically be discovered as well.  To teach Loot Detector about special ammo, drop a single round on the ground and let it be highlighted.\n<br />\n<br />[b]SYNTH INFILTRATOR DETECTION[/b]\n<br />Normally when you aim at a friendly they will be highlighted in cyan, but if you have synth highlighting active (and the requisites) synth infiltrators will highlight in gray instead.  When you detect a synth in your settlement, keep your gun trained on them and approach, they will panic and attack (or surrender).  Thus they can be eliminated without turning your settlement against you.\n<br />\n<br />[b]MANUAL OVERRIDE HOTKEY[/b]\n<br />You can map a key via MCM or other means to toggle all active effects.\n<br />Use this console command for manual mapping:\n<br />cqf xatmosScrapperQuest ToggleManualOverride\n<br />\n<br />[b]EXTRA PERK REQUIREMENTS\n<br />[/b](these are disabled by default)\n<br />\n<br />Some features can be gated behind perks as follows:\n<br />- Sleeping highlight requires Mister Sandman.\n<br />- Highlighting unassigned settlers and work objects requires Local Leader.\n<br />- Highlighting scrappable junk requires Scrapper rank 2.\n<br />- Highlighting doors requires VANS.\n<br />- Detecting friendlies requires Awareness.\n<br />- Detecting synth infiltrators requires Awareness AND Robotics Expert.\n<br />- Autolooting items requires Science! AND Scrounger OR Fortune Finder.\n<br />\n<br />[b]UPGRADING &amp; UNINSTALLING\n<br />[/b]Usually uninstalling or upgrading will not cause any problems.  But just to be extra safe, make multiple saves before upgrading or removing the mod.\n<br />\n<br />To fully uninstall, verify that the following files and/or folders are removed:\n<br />Fallout 4&#92;data&#92;scripts&#92;xatmosScrapper*.pex\n<br />Fallout 4&#92;data&#92;scripts&#92;xatmos&#92;xatmosScrapper*.pex\n<br />Fallout 4&#92;data&#92;MCM&#92;Config&#92;Loot Detector&#92;*\n<br />Fallout 4&#92;data&#92;MCM&#92;Config&#92;xatmosLootDetector&#92;*\n<br />Fallout 4&#92;data&#92;textures&#92;effects&#92;gradients&#92;xatmosScrapper&#92;*\n<br />\n<br />[b]INSTALLATION[/b]\n<br />Users of the pre-CK version of this mod should first uninstall everything related to it.  Do not install any \"patches\" for this mod, they are all outdated.\n<br />\n<br />NMM users should download the ESP version.  NMM does not properly support ESL files.  If you are new to modding and run into trouble give [url=http://wiki.tesnexus.com/index.php/Fallout_4_Mod_Installation]this page[/url] a read through!\n<br />\n<br />Don't forget to install the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/16899]Brawl Bug Fix[/url]﻿ by ErshinPL to prevent certain scripted events from breaking.\n<br />\n<br />The mod can take about a minute to boot up for the first time.\n<br />\n<br />[b]CONFIGURATION WITHOUT MCM\n<br />[/b]Check your inventory for the Loot Detector holotape.  Below is a description of each option:\n<br />\n<br />[Features]\n<br />Corpse Vision:  Highlight corpses and ashpiles with loot.\n<br />KO Vision:  Highlight unconscious (e.g drugged, knocked out, or powered down) actors.\n<br />Sandman Vision:  Highlight sleeping friends and foes.\n<br />Loot Vision:  Highlight keys, collectibles, and legendary items in the world (optionally more).\n<br />Dumpster Vision:  Highlight containers with loot.\n<br />Nerd Vision:  Highlight books, holotapes, and terminals.\n<br />Aiming IFF:  Highlight friendlies in ironsights or scoped.\n<br />Explorer Vision:  Highlight doors and door-like objects.\n<br />Taskmaster Vision:  Highlight unassigned settlers and objects, also settlers with quests.\n<br />Mechanist Vision:  Highlight broken and unpowered workshop objects.\n<br />\n<br />[Advanced]\n<br />Common Sundries:  Include ammo, chems, etc in world and inventory scans.\n<br />Survival Needs:  Include food, drink, and flora in scans.\n<br />Weightless Trifles:  Highlight and/or loot 0-weight items with a cap value.\n<br />Legendary Tracker:  Show or hide the tracker quest objective.\n<br />Proximity Suppression:  Suppress highlights on actors when in close proximity.\n<br />Component Highlighting:  Include scrappable junk.\n<br />Disable Vanilla Component Radar:  Prevent vanilla Scrapper2 highlighting.\n<br />Extra Perk Requirements:  Require additional perks for some features.\n<br />Unhighlighting:  Determines behavior for corpses and containers.\n<br />VATS Override:  Set how VATS interacts with highlight conditions..\n<br />Auto Collect:  Toggle auto-looting common sundries and junk.\n<br />Caps4Guns:  Automatically convert plain weapons to caps.\n<br />Voigt-Kampff Protocol:  Determine how to handle synth infiltrators.\n<br />Corpse Context:  Condition for highlighting remains.\n<br />Sandman Context:  Condition for highlighting unconscious actors.\n<br />Loot Context:  Condition for highlighting items and containers.\n<br />Explorer Context:  Condition for highlighting doors and nerd stuff.\n<br />Workshop Context:  Condition for workshop highlights.\n<br />\n<br />Currently there are more options that are only available in the MCM.\n<br />\n<br />[b]COMPATIBILITY[/b]\n<br />- Load order does not matter at all (no vanilla forms are modified).\n<br />- F4SE and MCM are not required, but highly recommended.\n<br />- No DLC is required.  All DLC is supported.\n<br />- The Unofficial Patch is highly recommended.\n<br />- Mods that change the boundaries of settlements could cause problems.\n<br />- Some items from other mods may not be detected within inventories.\n<br />- If junk components are changed, tracking may not be accurate.\n<br />- Only vanilla components (adhesive, steel, etc.) are supported.\n<br />\n<br />[b]KNOWN ISSUES[/b]\n<br />- Doors placed as static objects like rubble or fake walls may be highlighted.\n<br />- Flora that is not harvestable may be highlighted anyway.\n<br />- Shaders do not work on some transparent objects like glass beakers.\n<br />- Magnifying glass icon on tagged objects doesn't update until reload.\n<br />- The friendly highlight can get temporarily stuck if toggled rapidly.\n<br />- Shotgun ammo boxes highlight but do not trigger a proximity event.\n<br />[/size]",

            "description": "[size=5][u]Summar[/u]y[u]:[/u]\n<br />[/size]\n<br />I like looting.  I frequently lose track of all the corpses I create in my adventures which is detrimental to looting.  There are mods out there that highlight corpses, and some also only highlight if the corpse has loot that can be sold for caps but that solution requires you to take EVERYTHING from the corpse that has value (even if it's just 1 caps worth).  If you play in survival you have greatly reduced carry weight which prevents you from taking literally everything which means these solutions don't really work.  So I decided to make a solution of my own.\n<br />\n<br />When using berry mentats, power armor targeting hud, or anything else that grants \"detect life\" as a feature, slain enemies will highlight orange.  As soon as you investigate the corpse (the second the inventory menu pops up) the orange highlight will disappear.\n<br />\n<br />This effect only applies to enemies killed in game.  It does not show up on corpses that spawn in dead like the dog and wastelander just across the bridge from sanctuary to red rocket.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][u]Compatibilit[/u]y[u]:[/u]\n<br />[/size]\n<br />Mods that alter the targeting hud helmet mod for power armor, berry mentats, or the detect life effect will conflict.  I have provided compatibility patches for [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/8671/]Targeting HUD and Berry Mentats Enhanced[/url] and [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/17374]Horizon[/url].  Choose one or the other as they both override berry mentats.  Install both the main files and the patch file for whichever mod your using.\n<br />\n<br />Special note, it appears to override Horizon's white corpse highlight, even after the corpse is marked as looted.  I'll try to get them to play nice together but I don't really care about corpses I've already looted not highlighting anyways so not a huge priority to me.  Targeting HUD Enhanced on the other hand seems to play both shaders at once so you get blue smoke AND orange smoke which I think is a feature.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][u]Installin[/u]g[u]/Uninstallin[/u]g[u]:[/u][/size]\n<br />\n<br />Should be safe to install or uninstall whenever.  If you already have targeting hud on your power armor and you're IN your power armor when you load your save for the first time after installing you will have to leave your power armor and re-enter it for the effect to begin.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][u]Credits:[/u][/size]\n<br />\n<br />I made the shader effect by copying and modifying the base game's detect life shader effect so credit to bethesda for that file.  Also for making a game so easily and readily modifiable.  \n<br />\n<br />I also borrowed inspiration from Targeting hud enhanced so props to Yukichigai, the author, as well.\n<br />\n<br />I used FO4Edit to check compatibility and do general cleanup so credit should be given to the FO4Edit team.  A lot of this stuff wouldn't be possible without them.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Thanks and enjoy!",

Standard rusted materials, with stats supposedly weakening the weapon, living up to it's junky trashy nature.\n<br />1.) Shadowed rusted version is basically above, but with painted materials to increase stealth in dark areas. Useful for stealth-builds.\n<br /> - The first two are locked with Gun-Nut 1 as to not make the modification of weapons too easy without as much as even investing a single point in Gun-Nut.\n<br />\n<br />2.) Basically standard, all the penalties lifted.\n<br />3.) Like above, but increased stealth in dark areas.\n<br />4.) Somewhat better-materials via cleaning resulting in more damage.\n<br />5.) Quality materials further increases damage at the cost of more weight, and potentially more AP consumption. It's good for Non-VATS builds.\n<br />6.) High-Quality is an end-game materials, further increases damage at the cost of weight.\n<br />7.) Same as above but with a bit more weight and increased Stealth in dark areas.\n<br />8.) Very light-weight materials resulting in less AP consumption and better handling traits, at the cost of increased recoil.\n<br />9.) Cross-road between High-Quality and Aluminium, Alloyed materials give a bit nice handling traits yet give good damage bonus.\n<br />\n<br />Credits:\n<br /> - AlexSlesh - [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/3181/?]More Realistic Handmade Pipe Weapons[/url]\n<br /> - Johnsack2001 - [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/748/?]Darker pipe weapons[/url]\n<br /> - Billyro - [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/8141/?]Better Reflective Pipe Weapons[/url] \n<br /> - Acacyn - [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/742/?]Darker Pipe Rifle - Pistol - Revolver[/url]\n<br /> - murdalizer - [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/822/?]Brown to Gray Pipe Weapons[/url] \n<br /> - TrickyVein - [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/10484/?]Crossbows of the Commonwealth\n<br />\n<br />Modding Notes:\n<br /> - The actual textures and materials are separated at \"PWO ...\" so to not conflict with vanilla textures.

            "description": "Alright, I&#39;ve had to overhaul the description page due to the most recent update, which is a major overhaul.\r<br />\r<br />This mod now adds the following:\r<br />*All DLC Support for ammo machines and the ballistic weapon machine.\r<br />*A Chem machine.\r<br />*A &#34;Nuka-Loom&#34; machine.\r<br />*New Textures\r<br />*Tweaked ammo recipes from Manufacturing Extended.\r<br />*Armour machines allowing the construction of full armour sets.\r<br />\r<br />That&#39;s right. This mod builds upon the mod, Manufacturing Extended, by Kentington by adding and tweaking where he left off. Firstly, it&#39;s added the DLC ammo in to the base ammo machine, now called the Ballistic Ammo Machine. It has also added some new machines, the much requested Chem station, and the Energy Weapon ammo machine. As of right now, only the Ballistic ammo machine has its unique texture, but that is scheduled to change as the mod grows. It should also be noted while this builds upon Manufacturing Extended, it is [b]not [/b]required to use this mod. So if you&#39;re only after the DLC support, then this mod works just as well on its own.\r<br />\r<br />I have also played around with a few of the recipes that Kentington had provided when making the ammo because I felt they didn&#39;t fit. Such an example is replacing the copper in Plasma Cartridges to plastic, because they look more plastic than coppery.\r<br />\r<br />The chem machine at present only has base game chems, nothing from DLC. But it does allow the creation of Med-X, Rad-X and Buffout, recipes not in the base game. The Energy Weapon ammo machines does what it says on the box, and it now allows the creation of flares and fusion cores. All with balancing of course.\r<br />\r<br />Huge thanks to Cartman1975 to helping me figure out how to add recipes, as well as making me the new textures. As well as Kentington for making the original Manufacturing Extended mod.\r<br />\r<br />[center][/center][u][b][center]Recommended mods[/center][/b][/u][list]\r<br />[*][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/16810/?]Growable wild plants[/url] - Great for growing plants for the chem machine such as brain fungus and hubflower.\r<br />[*][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/15429/?]Manufacturing Extended[/url] - Goes without saying really.  This mod builds upon said mod, so I recommend it if you don&#39;t yet have it. Just ensure this mod is loaded over it however, as this mod fixes a few bugs that one had.\r<br />[*][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/14996/?]Worthwhile Eyebot Pods[/url] - Great for getting components for the manufacturing machines.

Nuclear nude does not replace these files by default (since it would increase filesize considerately) but you may experience a small seam/lighting issue in the backhead area when using some skins (or missing backhead tattoos on phoenix skins). \n<br />\n<br />the current solution is:\n<br />download the vanilla 'NUCLEAR Nude Main Skins MANUAL Install Files', \n<br />extract the skin that matches your currently installed cbbe skin\n<br />rename the file 'femalebody_d.dds' to 'femalebhed_d.dds'\n<br />rename the file 'femalebody_s.dds' to 'femalebhed_s.dds' \n<br />copy both of those files to Fallout 4/data/textures/actors/character/basehumanfemale/ and overwrite\n<br />\n<br />[color=#cc4125]How to uninstall:[/color]\n<br />\n<br />If you use NMM, simply right-click the mod and select 'Uninstall Mod'\n<br />\n<br />[i]manual uninstall:[/i]\n<br />\n<br />1. Navigate to &#92;Fallout 4&#92;Data&#92;textures&#92;actors&#92;character&#92;basehumanfemale&#92;\n<br />\n<br />2. For the skin - delete the files: \n<br />femalebody_d.dds, femalebody_s.dds, femalebody_n.dds, BaseFemaleHands_d.dds, BaseFemaleHands_s.dds\n<br />\n<br />3. For Raiders - delete the files: \n<br />FemaleBodyDirty_d.dds, FemaleBodyDirty_s.dds, FemaleBodyDirty_n.dds, BaseFemaleHandsDirty_d.dds, BaseFemaleHandsDirty_s.dds\n<br />\n<br />That's it\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][b][color=#d9ead3]Mini screenshot guide &amp; tips:[/color][/b][/size]\n<br />\n<br />1. look for a nice spot with good dynamic lighting and make sure you are in 3rd person view\n<br />2. open the console\n<br />3. type 'tfc 1' - this will enable free moving camera and pause all action\n<br />4. type 'sucsm 1' - this controls the speed of the free camera and brings it to a level where you can make good adjustments\n<br />5. optionally you can change the field of view with the command 'fov xx' where xx is the fov (ex 'fov 70')\n<br />6. close the console and use the controls to find a nice angle for a screenshot\n<br />7. when you found a good spot, open the console again\n<br />8. type 'tm' - this will hide all user interface and lock your current view, including the console so be warned! it is still active even tho you can't see it!\n<br />9. take screenshot by hitting print screen key\n<br />10. type 'tm' again to unhide the user interface - if you by accident closed the console, just hit the open console key and type 'tm'\n<br />11. type 'tfc' to return to normal game camera mode\n<br />12. your screenshot is saved in your fallout 4 game installation folder!\n<br />\n<br />Happy snapping!\n<br />\n<br />[center][/center]\n<br />[center][color=#ffa500][size=4][i]Recommended mods:[/i][/size][/color][/center]\n<br />\n<br />[center][size=4][b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/21248/?][color=#ffa07a]Unique NPCs - An Overhaul of the Commonwealth[/color][/url][/b]\n<br />[b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/12309/?][color=#ffa07a]Juicy Natural CBBE Bodyslide Preset[/color][/url][/b]\n<br />[b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/8126/?][color=#ffa07a]Ponytail Hairstyles by Azar[/color][/url][/b]\n<br />[b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/1369/?][color=#ffa07a]Wasteland Salon[/color][/url][/b]\n<br />[b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/169/?][color=#ffa07a]FCO - HD Eyes[/color][/url][/b]\n<br />[b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/819/?][color=#ffa07a]Eye Normal Map Fix[/color][/url][/b]\n<br />[b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/2227/?][color=#ffa07a]Harness Wardrobe - Craftable Variants and Replacers[/color][/url][/b]\n<br />[b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/14893/?][color=#ffa07a]Less intense grime[/color][/url][/b]\n<br />[b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/15084/?][color=#ffa07a]Hek-Ya Jane Body Presets Collection[/color][/url][/b]\n<br />[b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/19466/?][color=#ffa07a]Unique Female NPC Bodies | CBBE Body and Skin Overhaul[/color][/url][/b]\n<br />[b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/21683/?][color=#ffa07a]Athletic Beauty Bodyslide Preset[/color][/url][/b][/size][/center]\n<br />\n<br />[center][u][size=3][b][b][b][img]http://i.imgur.com/aH5JJUK.png[/img]\n<br />[/b][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[/b][/size][/u][/center][center][u][size=3]Like the mod?[/size][/u]\n<br />[b]Consider using the [/b][color=#93c47d]Endorse[/color][b] function or leave a comment![/b]\n<br />[b]Any feedback &amp; suggestions are welcome![/b]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[u][size=3]Donations[/size][/u]\n<br />[b]Donations are appreciated and serve as a great encouragement for mod authors![/b]\n<br />[b]- a big thank you to all who have already donated![/b]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2]How?[/size]\n<br />[b]Nexus has a build in donation system[/b]\n<br />[b]use the button on the top right of any mod page.[/b]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.patreon.com/zentreon][img]http://i.imgur.com/9RB2YVl.png[/img][/url]\n<br />\n<br />[b]Become a 'Harbinger of the Apocalypse'\n<br />Any contribution will be converted into pixels!\n<br />[/b](no special mod related services or benefits will be offered, all modding efforts will always be free)\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[u][size=3][b]Special Thanks to[/b][/size][/u]\n<br />\n<br />Bethesda for making a beautiful Fallout game!\n<br />matt3000 for creating a great nipple bodymesh!\n<br />OniNigma for permission to use enhanced perky bodymesh!\n<br />RexHarbinger for work on Shaggy skin!\n<br />Wolrajh for conversion of Vanilla Nuclear skins to CBBE!\n<br />Caliente for making the excellent CBBE mod!\n<br />Nightasy for making the amazing Jane Bod mod!\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]check out my other mods: \n<br />[/size]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16104][img]https://i.imgur.com/DFBgs7d.png[/img][/url]﻿\n<br />[b]Female UNP Skin for Skyrim (SE)﻿[/b]\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/14269/?][img]http://i.imgur.com/DLaJUMF.png[/img][/url]\n<br />[b]Lustrous skins for the Jane Bod[/b]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/13422/?][img]http://i.imgur.com/LLn8qhl.png[/img][/url]\n<br />[b]maybe you're a synth, maybe not..[/b]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/595/?][size=4]\n<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/z2HlCye.png[/img][/size][/url][/center][center][/center]\n<br />[center][/center]\n<br />\n<br />[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/Be9J3EW.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][b]Have fun and enjoy the apocalypse!\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[/b][/size][/center]",

Maybe you'd find the shredding Rapid Powerful 5mm Pipe PDW, or the steady chug of the Advanced-Auto .44/.308/.30-06 Pipe-HMG to be quite attractive. Do you intend to hybridize? Attach an Axe Stock or Spiked Grip, play it like a combination melee and ranged weapon. Do you fancy a Strength Build? The Heavy Barrel turns pipe-weapons into a Heavy-Gun!\n<br />\n<br />If you liked this mod, please endorse, and check out my other mods. ^_^\n<br />\n<br />Be sure to check out the links below first if you're interested in optimizing the Pipe Weapons as a whole, or simply do not know how to properly install a mod yet.[/quote]\n<br />CREDITS:\n<br />\n<br /> - Bethesda - Fallout 4 (And fcking some things up that we have to make mod to make it better)\n<br /> - opengts – Large Drum Magazine Model\n<br /> - Kashrlyyk and Elgoes – all other models \n<br /> - LinuX123 - Gunner Sight model\n<br /> - Kriskos - FOMOD Template (I suck at this fomod thing)\n<br /> - Sean_s - Flashlight Model\n<br /> - TrickyVein - Crossbow Spiked Stirrup + Long Barrels\n<br /> - henkspamadres - Deathclaw Bayonet\n<br /> - JKruse05 - Pipe Revolver\n<br /> - Veratai - Axe Stock\n<br />\n<br />Useful Links:\n<br />\n<br /> - [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/4809/?]Pipe Weapons Mag-In Sound Fix[/url]\n<br /> - [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/8666/?]Moddable Pipe Weapon Materials[/url] (Retexture Set)\n<br /> - [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/9476/?]See-Through Combat Scopes - 4x Magnification[/url]\n<br /> - [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/5406/?]Legendary Modification Rebalance[/url]\n<br /> - [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/4042/?]Craftable Legendary Mods[/url]\n<br /> - [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/41236]Strength-Based Bash-Bonus[/url]\n<br />\n<br />My Weapon Overhauls:\n<br />\n<br /> &gt; [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/7556]Pipe Weapons[/url] + [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/8666]Materials[/url]  \n<br /> &gt; [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/4227]Minigun[/url]  \n<br /> &gt; [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/4711]Laser Musket[/url]  \n<br /> &gt; [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/6742]Gatling Laser[/url]  \n<br /> &gt; [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/15696]Laser-Plasma[/url]  \n<br /> &gt; [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/15166]Missile Launcher[/url] \n<br /> &gt; [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/40765]SMG[/url]  \n<br /> &gt; [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/41119]Railway[/url]  \n<br /> &gt; [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/41160]Hunting Rifle[/url]  \n<br /> &gt; [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/41231]Combat Weapons[/url] \n<br /> &gt; [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/41269]Assault Rifle[/url]  \n<br /> &gt; [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/41303]Lever Rifle[/url] \n<br /> &gt; [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/41304]Radium Rifle[/url] \n<br /> &gt; [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/41326]Handmade Rifle[/url] \n<br /> &gt; [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/41315]Sidearms[/url]\n<br /> &gt; [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/41297]Double-Barrel[/url] \n<br /> &gt; [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/41420]Flamer[/url] \n<br /> &gt; [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/41497]Fatman[/url]\n<br /> &gt; [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/41344]All-In-One Merged Pack[/url]\n<br />\n<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<br />\n<br /> - [url=https://wiki.tesnexus.com/index.php/Fallout_4_Mod_Installation]How to install mods[/url]\n<br /> - [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZpIQ6P38xE]How to install mods manually demo[/url]\n<br /> - [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAKcAEn6hLg]How to install mods using NMM demo[/url]\n<br />\n<br />Main Changes:\n<br />\n<br />1.)

There's also explosive slug with slower projectile speed but deals AOE damage, and Incendiary that bathes an area with a cloud of fire. \n<br />\n<br />3.) Added and Changed Things\n<br />\n<br /> - Certain NPCs are tougher, such as Diamond Security, and Lucy Abernathy.\n<br /> - Did you ever notice how the glow of the Glow-Sights seems to tarnish?

It no longer weakens anymore.\n<br /> - Added Large Suppressors and rebalanced Suppressors.\n<br /> - Rebalanced Recoil of Pipe Weapon Attachments\n<br /> - Separated Bayonets from the Muzzle, simplifying the combination. Now Added underbarrel slot, with the Bayonets and flashlight.\n<br /> - Long-Barrels to \"Carbine Barrels\", and new Long Barrels with more range. Recalibrated Barrels' bonuses, with lesser AP penalties and redistributed recoil and ADS spread. Finned series has the least Hip-Fire spread penalty of the length.\n<br /> - Added Large Drum Magazine for the Pipe-Gun, sporting 120 capacity, and even lesser handling qualities.\n<br /> - Added Small Magazines for the Pipe Gun, sporting only 10 Capacity, but improved handling traits.\n<br /> - Added \"Night Recon\" Scope series, Combined Recon + Night Vision.\n<br /> - Added “Heavy” barrels: provides the most accuracy, range, and recoil-reduction in their Length.

Chokes are tapering of the barrel by the muzzle, that which tightens the spread.\n<br /> - Choke, Half Choke, and Full Choke tightens spread, and improves range by 10/20/30% at the cost of more recoil.\n<br /> - Rebalanced Incendiary Legendary to do 28 damage over 6s, that stacks.\n<br /> - Fixed Drum-Mag Brackets. If you don't know, originally, it moves with the magazine, and now it doesn't.\n<br /> - Added Spiked Sharpshooter's Grip and Axe Stock, requiring Gun-Nut 2, and Blacksmith 1. Deals heavy bash damage, but does not stack with Bayonets.\n<br />\n<br />4.)

The NPCs that wielded them, except Amelia, has increased Health, Energy, and Aggression. \n<br />\n<br />[quote] - Peacemaker (xx000B36): \"Six rounds, no compromise.

Has \"Violent\" legendary attachment, spawns with Heavy Short Barrel, Glow-Sights, Heavy-Frame,  Sharpshooter's Grip, and pistol caliber; .45-Receiver, .44-Magnum, or .500-Magnum at higher levels.[/quote][quote] - Lady Luck (xx000B37): \"The personification of luck, Lady Luck makes Critical a gamble that you make or break.\"\n<br />\n<br />Pipe Assault-Rifle of [b]Red Tourette,[/b] Designed for heavy-damaging VATs crit, to vomit bullets; using the Long-Burst offered by the Rapid Automatic + 100% Crit bonus of \"Calibrated\" + \"Lucky-Weapon\"' 100% crit-bonus as well, the \"Lady Luck\" packs one hell of a VATs Crit, and you can always pair it with Better Criticals perk. Has \"Lucky Weapon\" legendary attachment, spawns with Heavy Short Barrel, Glow-Sights, Quick-Eject Large-Magazine, Marksman's Stock, Heavy-Frame, Rapid Automatic Trigger, Calibrated, Armor-Piercing, and uses 5mm, 5.56mm, .308, or .30-06. [/quote][quote] - Quickcaster (xx000B42): \"Professionals shoot twice.\"\n<br />\n<br />Pipe Sniper-Rifle of [b]Sully Mathis [/b][Pull the Plug], has \"Vats-Enchanced\" legendary attachment, -40% AP cost version which is not available for guns normally.

Far-Harbor Changes:\n<br />\n<br />  - \"M4-Carbine\" Legendary; December's Child has +35% damage, +35% rate of fire, +25% reload-speed and -50% weight.\n<br />  - Bertha and Tony looks less beggars, with Small Bertha 10% taller, to make her look more a teenager and less of a child.\n<br />  - Bilge uses the legendary weapon: \"Deuce Ex\" Pipe Gun LMG, with Steadfast Legendary. (xx000804) \n<br />  - Malcolm uses the legendary weapon: \"Right-Arm of the Wasteland\" Pipe Battle Rifle, with Retarded Auto, and has Deadeye Legendary. (xx000806)\n<br />  - Braun uses the legendary weapon: \"Russian Roulette\" Pipe Revolver, with Heavy Short Barrel, and Defiant Legendary. (xx000807)\n<br />  - \"Glorious Revolution\" is lootable from Douglas. Pipe Revolver, with Heavy Short Barrel, and Resilient Legendary. (xx000807)\n<br />  - \"Victoria's Secret\" is lootable in Southwest Harbor inside \"Victoria's Trunk\", it is a Pipe Scout-Rifle with stub barrel and suppressor, and has Hitman Legendary. (xx000823)\n<br />\n<br />7.) Nuka-World changes:\n<br />\n<br />  - Added 7.62mm Reciever, deals 29 for Pipe Gun, 37 for Bolt Action, 33 for Revolver with capacity of 8. Has 1.00 Speed.\n<br />  - Handmade Rifle damage from 32, to 40. Full-Auto fire Rate from 1.25 to 1, and more recoil.\n<br />  - Handmade Rifle chamberings 5.56mm, 5mm, and .308.\n<br />  - Handmade Rifle Quick Eject Small Mag to Quick Eject Mag with 20 round capacity.\n<br />  - Rebalanced Handmade Rifle receivers to follow traditional trend; 25% each step.\n<br />\n<br />8.) Optional Tweaks - included is changes to other weapons instead. \n<br />\n<br /> - Rechambered Deliverer to .38, reduced damage to 16.\n<br />\n<br /> - Double Barrel Shotgun deals 70 damage, from 45. Stagger Increased to Extra Large. Deals 100% damage bonus at point-blank range.\n<br /> - Combat Shotgun' Stagger increased to Large. Deals 100% damage bonus at point-blank range.\n<br />  - Double-Barrel Shotgun has \"Double Fire\" feature which uses Twin Shotgun-Shells (custom ammo craftable at Chemistry Workbench), has double everything.\n<br />  - Chokes are integrated with Double-Barrel and Combat Shotgun.\n<br />  - .44-Magnum has Trigger mod \"Fanned Trigger\"\n<br />  - Mini Nuke, and Nuke Mines can incinerate, like Laser Gun.\n<br />  - Mr. Gutsy uses 5.56mm.\n<br />  - Sentry Bots uses .50 Cal and increased damage to 36, and speed to 12.7 -- the same speed as SMGs.\n<br />  - Legendary Mods: Powerful to +35%, Violent to +50% damage and limb damage. Powerful, Violent, and Two-Shot now has Multiplicative than Additive Damage.\n<br />\n<br />Notes:\n<br />  - The Heavy Barrel and Shotgun Grenade rounds turn the weapon into a Heavy Gun that is improved by the Heavy Gunner perk. This ties in with the melee-attachments, allowing a strength-based build.\n<br />  - Nick Valentine’s Revolver comes with attachments. Using the console command, use \"00002f25.removeitem 5bba7; 00002f25.additem 5bba7\" (without the quotes) to reset his default weapon.\n<br />  - The Legendary Weapons may fail to spawn if you have already encountered the NPCs that wielded them or containers that have them.\n<br />  - This mod cuts both ways, making the wielder of the weapons a bit more powerful, as such in the enemies' hands it will be equally painful to deal with.\n<br />  - This mod conflicts with any mod that modifies any Object Modification entities, as such it's not compatible with the Better Mod Descriptions, any mod that modifies the Player NPC directly, as well as anything that adds new Receivers for any of the three pipe weapons. Since the mod borrows sound from something like .44 Pistol, should the sound used by the .44 Pistol is changed, this weapon’s .44 Pistol sound will also change. This also applies to all calibers and to automatic and suppressed fire modes too.\n<br />  - The naming mechanism conflicts with any mods that modify it, such as Valdacil's Better Item-Sorting Mod. While it works, it just doesn't apply to the three weapons as they use a different INNR record. There is a compatibility patch for that -- not that it uses Valdacil's but it's made to somewhat fit.\n<br />  - I also tweaked the Loading Screen.\n<br />  -  The sound change uses the default sounds of other weapons via keywords. If you change sounds of any of the default weapon, this means the used sound of this weapons will change too. E.g. if you changed the 10mm Pistol's sound, the 10mm Receiver also changes sound.\n<br />\n<br />[quote] - Currently, the Pipe Revolver has [color=gold][b]hundreds of millions[/b][/color] of possible combinations:  \n<br />\n<br />  &gt; Basic: = 9 (Receiver) x 13 (Barrels) x 8 (Stocks/Grips) x 4 (damage mod) x 2 (trigger mod) x 3 (frame mod) x 2 (calibration) x 6 (ammo mod) x 23 (Sights/Scopes) = 6200064 (10,055,232 with DLC)\n<br />  &gt; Bayonet is not allowed with suppressors, = 6 (Underbarrel) x 5 (Muzzles) = 30, subtract suppressor-bayonet combination = 26 x 6200064 = 161,201,664 (261,436,032 with DLC)\n<br />  &gt; Heavy Barrels can only put flashlights: 3 x 8 x 9 x 4 x 2 x 3 x 2 x 6 x 23 x 3 = 4,292,352 (5,246,208 with DLC)\n<br />  &gt; Shotgun = 13 x 8 x 4 x 2 x 3 x 2 x 3 (Ammo type excluding Explosive Slugs) x 23 x 26 x 4 (Chokes) = 35,822,592\n<br />  &gt; Heavy Barrel Shotgun: 8 x 4 x 2 x 3 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 23 x 6 x 4 = 2,543,616\n<br />  &gt; Slug Shotgun (No Snub): 3 (Barrels) x 8 x 4 x 2 x 3 x 2 x 2 (Two Ammo types) x 23 x 4 x 6 = 423,936\n<br />  &gt; Snub Slug Shotgun (No suppressed): 3 (Muzzles) x 8 x 4 x 2 x 3 x 2 x 2 (Two Ammo types) x 23 x 4 x 6 (Underbarrels) = 1,271,808\n<br />  &gt; Snub Slug Shotgun (suppressed): 2 (Muzzles) x 8 x 4 x 2 x 3 x 2 x 2 (Two Ammo types) x 23 x 4 x 4 (underbarrel w/o Bayonets) = 565,248\n<br />\n<br />161,201,664 + 4,292,352 + 35,822,592 + 2,543,616 + 423,936 + 1,271,808 + 565,248 = [color=gold][b][size=4]206,121,216[/size][/b][/color][/quote][quote] - Currently, the Pipe Bolt Action has [color=gold][b]hundreds of millions[/b][/color] of possible combinations:  \n<br />\n<br />  &gt; Basic: = 6 (Receiver) x 13 (Barrels) x 8 (Stocks/Grips) x 4 (damage mod) x 2 (trigger mod) x 3 (frame mod) x 2 (calibration) x 6 (ammo mod) x 23 (Sights/Scopes) = 4,133,376\n<br />  &gt; Bayonet is not allowed with suppressors, = 6 (Underbarrel) x 5 (Muzzles) = 30, subtract suppressor-bayonet combination = 26 x 4,133,376 = 10,7467,776\n<br />  &gt; Heavy Barrels can only put flashlights: 3 x 8 x 6 x 4 x 2 x 3 x 2 x 6 x 23 x 3 = 2,861,568\n<br />  &gt; Shotgun = 13 x 8 x 4 x 2 x 3 x 2 x 3 (Ammo type excluding Explosive Slugs) x 23 x 26 x 4 (Chokes) = 35,822,592\n<br />  &gt; Heavy Barrel Shotgun: 8 x 4 x 2 x 3 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 23 x 6 x 4 = 2,543,616\n<br />  &gt; Slug Shotgun (No Snub): 3 (Barrels) x 8 x 4 x 2 x 3 x 2 x 2 (Two Ammo types) x 23 x 4 x 6 = 423,936\n<br />  &gt; Snub Slug Shotgun (No suppressed): 3 (Muzzles) x 8 x 4 x 2 x 3 x 2 x 2 (Two Ammo types) x 23 x 4 x 6 (Underbarrels) = 1,271,808\n<br />  &gt; Snub Slug Shotgun (suppressed): 2 (Muzzles) x 8 x 4 x 2 x 3 x 2 x 2 (Two Ammo types) x 23 x 4 x 4 (underbarrel w/o Bayonets) = 565,248\n<br />\n<br />10,7467,776 + 2,861,568 + 35,822,592 + 2,543,616 + 423,936 + 1,271,808 + 565,248 = [color=gold][b][size=4]150,956,544[/size][/b][/color][/quote][quote] - Currently, the Pipe Gun has [color=gold][b]BILLIONS[/b][/color] of possible combinations: \n<br />\n<br />  &gt; Basic: 9 (Receiver) x 13 (Barrels) x 8 (Stocks/Grips) x 10 (Magazines) x 4 (damage mod) x 6 (trigger mod) x 3 (frame mod) x 2 (calibration) x 6 (Ammo Mod) x 23 (Sights/Scopes)  = 186,001,920\n<br />  &gt; Bayonet is not allowed with suppressors, = 6 (Underbarrel) x 5 (Muzzles) = 30, subtract suppressor-bayonet combination = 26 x 186,001,920 = 4,836,049,920\n<br />  &gt; Heavy Barrel can only use flashlights: 9 x 3 x 8  x 4 x 6 x 3 x 2 x 6 x 23 x 3 = 12,877,056\n<br />\n<br />4,836,049,920 +  12,877,056 = [color=gold][b][size=4]4,848,926,976.[/size][/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Lots of different possible combinations, lol.

Visit me here about this or any other of my mods: [url=https://discord.gg/jMUnXDV]https://discord.gg/jMUnXDV[/url]\n<br />\n<br />Adapted and expanded from my mod \"[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/29957]Pack Attack[/url]\", this mod significantly extends the same concepts and ideas into a combat AI mod that specifically applies to biped gang enemies, such as Raiders and Gunners.  As in \"Pack Attack\", enemies using this mod will adjust their tactics based on their social and threat awareness, switching between ranged, melee, defensive, and offensive tactics based on their perceptions of team advantage and individual risk.  \n<br />\n<br />[b]Please note: Due to the rapid development and evolution of this mod, this description page may be incomplete, outdated, and/or inaccurate.[/b]  For the latest information, please read the comments section.  You can also find information about mod compatibility, MCM settings, and playing strategy in the Articles section.  \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]IMPORTANT[/b] \n<br />===================================\n<br />\n<br />Do [b]NOT[/b] use this and my original Pack Attack mod together!  That one was the original very crude prototype that gradually evolved into this mod, and Pack Attack NPC Edition (or PA-NPC, for short) includes and expands on all that mod's functionality.  They will not play nice together! \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]CHANGELOG[/b] \n<br />===================================\n<br />\n<br />To better keep track of everything and maintain my own sanity in the process, [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/articles/849]this mod's project changelog can be found here[/url].\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]DESCRIPTION[/b]\n<br />===================================\n<br />\n<br />\"[b]Pack Attack: NPC Edition[/b]\" applies the basic dog pack AI methodology from \"[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/29957]Pack Attack[/url]\" to NPC gangs, but significantly expands on it.\n<br />\n<br />This mod makes major changes to how supported NPC groups fight.  Rather than simply rushing you in the open as a group, these NPCs will break and cover, retreat and flank, run and hide, and even lie in wait.  They're more likely to ambush, less likely to engage in suicidal charges, and more certain to switch to hand-to-hand combat if you get too close and they like their odds.  In short, PA-NPC completely overhauls and upgrades the combat AI for all supported NPC groups.\n<br />\n<br />And they will attempt to make these tactical decisions based on what is happening around them.\n<br />\n<br />Each NPC gathers information from their experiences, coordinates information with their teammates, and even learns to a limited degree.  This leads to fights that are never the same twice, that actively require you to consider the risks versus rewards of a particular assault or combat approach.\n<br />\n<br />In addition, PA-NPC now contains several features for dynamic enemy spawning, non-combat AI, and upgrades/new abilities for individual NPC groups.  All in all, this project has now evolved into a general NPC upgrade for the entirety of the Fallout 4 experience.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]HOW PA-NPC DIFFERS FROM OTHER AI MODS[/b]\n<br />========================================\n<br />\n<br />There are many fine AI overhaul mods available on the Nexus.  They all basically do the same things: adjust the global game settings and update the combat style definitions.\n<br />\n<br />PA-NPC doesn't change globals, and rather than alter existing combat styles, it substitutes its own.  Where PA-NPC differs is that it adds an additional layer of processing on top of the combat style system.  Rather than having a single defined combat style (as in vanilla), PA-enabled animals have five of them, and biped NPCs (humans, etc.) have [i]nine different combat styles[/i], switching between them as their combat environment and relative perspective changes.  To the best of my knowledge, Pack Attack is the only Fallout AI mod to have attempted this.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Important note: many AI mods, such as Arbitration and Search and Destroy, \"improve\" NPC attack behavior by making the vanilla system overall much more sensitive.  PANPC doesn't need the help.  Using them together will have unintended consequences.[/b]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]SPECIAL NOTE ABOUT F4SE[/b]\n<br />========================================\n<br />\n<br />[i]As of v1.7, I have retired the non-F4SE version of PANPC.  The honest truth is that it's a hassle to support both user bases, and the non-F4SE base isn't large enough to justify it.  I may release bugfixes for it once in a while, but for now, v1.69 will be the final, canon non-F4SE version of PANPC.[/i]\n<br />\n<br />The aim of this project is to improve the general enemy AI as much as possible through the use of group dynamics and tactics.  To that end, I prefer not to leave any useful tools lying on the table, and without question that includes F4SE.\n<br />\n<br />There are now two general releases of PA-NPC.  The main release requires F4SE, and utilizes that additional capability to include factors such as detailed weapon comparison (i.e., don't take a pipe gun to a Gauss Gun fight).  This will always be the primary release version, and while not every new feature will be based on F4SE functions, any new features incorporated into this release WILL NOT be backported to non-F4SE version.\n<br />\n<br />The non-F4SE version remains version 1.69, and is available under Optional Files.  I will continue to maintain this version only for critical (i.e., game breaking) bug fixes.  Do not ask me to backport.  If you want the new features, install F4SE.\n<br />\n<br />Beyond simply not wanting to maintain two separate mods here, my other concern is game balancing.  I spend a lot of time testing, tweaking, and testing again, and balancing takes a lot of time.  As new features are included, I would have to do all that work separately for each version, and I'm not going to do that.  Thanks for understanding.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]HOW IT WORKS[/b]\n<br />========================================\n<br />\n<br />[b]IMPORTANT POINT:[/b] The Fallout 4 engine is designed to allow for the influence of combat behavior, but not the [i]control[/i] of combat behavior (with a few exceptions).  All this or any other mod can do is coax an actor into a certain level of aggression and combat behavior.  So expect some strange behavior - once the combat starts, the NPCs are making their own decisions, and they may not always be the brightest ones.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />This mod had its genesis in its predecessor mod, \"Pack Attack\".  Pack Attack upgraded the Commonwealth's canines, emulating basic pack behavior and social awareness in combat situations.  When a PA-enabled Mongrel is loaded into the game, it does an immediate scan for other dogs, and acts more confidently and aggressively when it has company. \n<br />\n<br />In the vanilla game, an Actor (you, me, dogs, robots, etc.) has an Aggression stat (how likely it is to attack), a Confidence stat (cowardly/brave/foolhardy), and a general Combat Style (which specifies combat behavior in more detail).  Normally these stats are hardwired into Actors, including dogs.  If an Actor is a coward, they're usually - but not always - a coward forever.  But those stats can be changed on the fly.  \"Pack Attack\" constantly adjusted those settings for each dog as its fortunes changed in combat.\n<br />\n<br />PA-NPC takes that same basic idea and expands it significantly for use with NPC gang enemies.  When a PA-NPC is active, he (or she) will perform regular scans of the local environment and assess the local relative strength of his gang.  If he finds other faction-friendly teammates in the area, he will act more confidently and aggressively.  If he's alone and hurt, he's more likely to run and hide.\n<br />\n<br />In addition, PA-NPC actors consider:\n<br />\n<br />* [b]High ground advantage[/b]: \"Am I fairly safe up on this freeway or rooftop?\"\n<br />* [b]Visible weapon comparisons[/b]: \"Am I bringing a knife to a gunfight?\"\n<br />* [b]Power Armor advantage[/b]: \"Am I wearing power armor?  Is my target?\"\n<br />* [b]Outnumbering advantage[/b]: \"Am I feeling pretty good about our numbers here?\"\n<br />* [b]Group aggression[/b]: \"Does it feel like we're winning this battle?\"\n<br />* [b]Target distance[/b]: \"Is my target close enough to warrant a shift to hand-to-hand or melee combat?\"\n<br />* [b]Self preservation[/b]: \"Is the smartest move here to run away and fight another day?\"\n<br />* [b]Radiation exposure:[/b] \"Am I currently taking radiation damage?\" (new to v1.7)\n<br />\n<br />.. and much more.\n<br />\n<br />PA-NPC uses more combat styles than the original Pack Attack did, and each NPC will shift styles as necessary between ranged, melee, and evasion tactics.  As the gang dwindles in size, it will lose battle cohesion.  If, on the other hand, the gang is winning, they will become bolder and more direct in their fire tactics.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Here are the important concepts:\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]COURAGE[/b]\n<br />========================================\n<br />\n<br />Each PA-NPC, when first enabled, is assigned a random value within a faction-specified range that represents their natural courage.  This value will rise and fall as the NPC gains experience and faces combat events.  In general, a higher courage NPC is more likely to be confident and aggressive, as well as more willing to make command decisions.  A lower courage NPC will be a follower more than a leader, be more apt to run and evade than charge and fight, and will more prefer fighting at a distance to up-close-and-personal slugfests.\n<br />\n<br />The rest of this mod is based around this Courage value, which remains as long as the NPC reference is alive.  In a very simple but very real way, they \"learn\" and individualize as they gain experience.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]SELF PRESERVATION[/b]\n<br />========================================\n<br />\n<br />Countering the NPC's Courage stat is their Self Preservation stat.  While not nearly as important to their decisions as is Courage, the NPC's SP stat will generally lower when they make kills or participate in command or revenge actions.  It will rise as they take damage and when they flee.  Self Preservation generally works against Courage, as the NPC attempts to decide whether to boldly attack, retreat, flank, or run for the hills.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]GANG EVALUATION[/b]\n<br />===================================\n<br />\n<br />As with \"Pack Attack\", the heart of this mod is the gang assessment system.  Each active NPC is constantly searching within a dynamic radius (based on its Perception stat) for other friends and enemies.  When it finds another friendly NPC, it evaluates that NPC's base health in comparison to its own, using that data to get a rough (and relative) collective estimate of the gang strength.  \n<br />\n<br />Here is how it works.  Imagine we're talking about two raiders: Tiny Tim and Big Bubba.\n<br />\n<br />Tiny Tim has a base health of 50HP.  Big Bubba, on the other hand, is a much bigger guy: 150HP base health.  Tim is going to look at Bubba and think, \"Wow, that guy is three times my size and he's on OUR side.  We can't lose!\" and be more reckless as a result. Bubba, meanwhile, is more likely to look down at Tiny Tim and think, \"I'm surrounded by guys a third of my size, and I'm going to have to do all the work here.  This is not a great situation for me.\"  He will be more likely to hang back and fight conservatively.\n<br />\n<br />Each PA-NPC makes this assessment with each allied or friendly NPC in their scan radius, using the sum of those judgments as a base to assess the overall strength of the gang - from their own point of view.  There is no \"objective\" pack strength.  It's all relative, each NPC making imperfect decisions based on their own individual perspective.\n<br />\n<br />Each NPC has a random bravery/anxiety factor that will make it a bit more anxious or bold than the others (to avoid duplicating behavior), and utilizes various other data points - wounded enemies (blood scent), its own health, and its most recent combat experience - to decide whether to attack, run away, be cautious, or go completely bloodthirsty insane.  That base \"courage\" value goes up and down as the NPC gets hit, or makes kills.  It is then used as the base for future evaluation calculations.\n<br />\n<br />In general, as each NPC senses a weaker and more damaged pack, it will become more and more likely to retreat, evade, and hide.  Likewise, if another NPC enters the fray, the other NPCs will react to the gang's suddenly improved fortunes and become more aggressive.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]FIGHT/FLIGHT[/b]\n<br />========================================\n<br />\n<br />PA-NPC enemies operate in two basic modes: proactive and reactive.  A proactive decision is a measured appraisal of the gang dynamics and tactical situation, followed by a random timeout period of up to 30 seconds before reconsidering their decision.\n<br />\n<br />During the timeout period, the NPC is in reactive mode.  Their decision making process is much simpler, more fight/flight.  In this mode, the enemy NPC is much more likely to do something stupid, more likely to aggressively defend themselves, and more likely to run in panic.  They will continue in this reactive decision mode until the timeout expires, at which point they'll make another proactive tactical decision.\n<br />\n<br />Each proactive decision changes the NPC's aggression and confidence stats, as well as their combat style.  There are melee and ranged, offensive and defensive fighting styles. \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]COMMAND (FOCUSED FIRE)[/b]\n<br />========================================\n<br />\n<br />Certain factions - Gunners, Minutemen, Brotherhood, and Synths - now have what I call the Command ability.  When a member of one of these factions gains a kill or two and raises their courage, the script will sometimes assign them a Command token that they can then spend on a high profile target (such as an enemy in power armor, or someone exposed on high ground).  When they spend that token, the target is marked as a Command target, and nearby teammates will prioritize their fire focus on that target.  The NPC that makes the kill gets a substantial courage bonus.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]FRIENDS AND ENEMIES[/b]\n<br />========================================\n<br />\n<br />PA-NPC enemies will only count faction-friendly NPCs as part of their gang.  This means in certain situations, it's entirely possible to have multiple NPC gangs slugging it out using PA-NPC tactic sets. \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]STEALTH, LOW LIGHT, DETECTION[/b]\n<br />========================================\n<br />\n<br />PA-NPC enemies make decisions based on what they can see and hear.  LOS (Line of Sight) between NPCs is a big deal, and LOS is mitigated by a variety of factors, first and foremost low light.  Staying in shadows, moving at night, and generally not making a good target of yourself are all tactics that play larger roles in PANPC than they do in the vanilla game.  Crouch-sneaking, Sneak perks, high AGL, and avoiding LOS are all excellent tools for avoiding unprepared-for combat situations.\n<br />\n<br />Likewise, PA-NPC enemies are MUCH more aware of their environments than are their vanilla counterparts.  They will investigate noise, set ambushes, and will tend to be quieter (fewer \"barks\") when they are alone or relatively isolated.  So be careful, because your enemies are going to be careful, too.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]DAZZLE[/b] (v1.771+ only)\n<br />========================================\n<br />\n<br />As of v1.771, PA-NPC enemies can be rendered temporarily (3-5 seconds) blind to the PANPC scanning systems.  During this period, they will take minor Perception damage, their aim will be severely degraded, and a large portion of their attempts to visually identify both targets and allies will fail.  They will take a minor courage hit, and if they are already having courage issues, they will be more prone to panic and retreat.\n<br />\n<br />This effect will naturally trigger from time to time in the regular game when NPCs are exposed to sudden increases in light brightness.  \n<br />\n<br />For players who prefer a more reliable method for dazzling their enemies, the PANPC download now includes an optional ESP that adds PANPC-enabled flash grenades and flash mines to the game.  They're adapted from their pulse cousins, do very little damage, explode with 1/10 of the force, and have about 50% more range.  NPCs caught in the explosion radius have a 50% chance of being dazzled (33% if the NPC is equipped with optics).\n<br />\n<br />PANPC flash weapons should start appearing in loot and vendor lists at around level 10, and I'm not doing injector lists, so you'll need to reconcile the lists in FO4Edit if you have other mods statically adding grenades and mines to those lists.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]SNIPER[/b] (v1.78+ only)\n<br />========================================\n<br />\n<br />As of v1.78, PA-NPC enemies that are spawned armed with a ballistic weapon equipped with a long range mod (such as long barrel) will adopt an extended set of fire tactics, in addition to their normal actions.  These \"Snipers\" will crouch when they fire (for an aim bonus), will prefer ranged attacks from held, fixed positions, and will attempt to fight from the rear of groups while their comrades lead frontal assaults.  If a Sniper also has a scope mod on their weapon, they will get an additional 20% aim bonus, stacking with whatever other aim bonuses they currently have.  Finally, they will also have a 50% better view of the battlefield than their teammates.\n<br />\n<br />Synths and super mutants do not use Sniper actions, no matter what weapon they are using.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]EXTRA SPAWNS[/b]\n<br />========================================\n<br />\n<br />Disabled by default, this feature allows you to automatically spawn in additional enemies when a PA-enabled NPC is loaded into game memory for the first time.  The new enemies will be spawned from that NPC's leveled list, each with its own equipment and configuration.\n<br />\n<br />In the MCM menu, you can adjust the odds of each NPC cloning a new spawn, how many possible spawns they can clone, and overall odds for generating the new clone NPC as a Boss, Higher Level, Tougher than PC, or PC-equal level.\n<br />\n<br />For more information about this (or any other) MCM feature, read the MCM instructions in the Articles section.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]RAIDING PARTIES[/b]\n<br />========================================\n<br />\n<br />Much like the extra spawns/clones, the Raiding Parties option (also enabled via MCM) occasionally sets a small group of enemies against you.  The type of enemy generally depends on the dominant gang in the area, and you can adjust the time interval and makeup of the groups in MCM.  They may come right at you, but they will most likely sneak up on and ambush you from a relatively safe spot.  \n<br />\n<br />You can adjust the time interval as a matter of game hours: every hour, two hours, etc.  But this is only a general time, and a new raiding party will spawn into your vicinity at any point between 30 minutes before or 30 minutes after the set interval.  If you have the interval set to 2 hours, for example, the script will spawn a new raiding party anywhere between 1.5 hours and 2.5 hours since the last one.\n<br />\n<br />If Raiding Parties and Extra Spawns are both enabled, the party will split up and each member will lead their own band of clones against your position. \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]INTEGRATION WITH WEST TEK OPTICS[/b]\n<br />========================================\n<br />\n<br />As of v1.74, PANPC now includes integration with [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/12220]\"West Tek Tactical Optics\" by fadingsignal[/url].  If you have WTTO installed, NPCs (including companions) with WTTO optics gear in their inventories will equip them at night and in low light.  NPCs with optics will not suffer from low light LOS (line of sight) penalties, while giving them a 20% aim bonus and greater team cohesion abilities.  \n<br />\n<br />The player does not receive any special bonuses in PANPC from West Tek Optics.  \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]CONFLICTS AND ISSUES[/b]\n<br />========================================\n<br />\n<br />While fairly stable at this point, this mod is still very experimental and SIGNIFICANTLY changes how NPCs fight.  All these changes are bound within the faction system (without changing any factions), and so hopefully should not break any quests.  However, I can't guarantee that any particular version of this mod is perfectly ironclad, is save game safe, or won't CTD somewhere.\n<br />\n<br />If you happen to encounter a situation where you believe this mod is breaking your game, please let me know in as much detail as possible.  If you think you've found a bug, [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/articles/1895]please read this article[/url] as well as the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/articles/821]Compatibility Status[/url] page before reporting it.  Thanks.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]INSTALLATION/UNINSTALLATION[/b]\n<br />========================================\n<br />\n<br />As of v1.7, only the base game and F4SE 0.4.0+ are required.  The script will auto detect any DLCs and make the appropriate settings.\n<br />\n<br />Likewise, the v1.69 legacy non-F4SE version is also fully DLC compatible, but does not require F4SE.\n<br />\n<br />While MCM is required to use the MCM features, it is not required for using either version of this mod.\n<br />\n<br />Unpack the RAR to install, disable the ESP in your load order to disable. \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]DONATIONS[/b]\n<br />========================================\n<br />\n<br />Always appreciated, never required.  I do this stuff because I'm a hopeless Fallout addict, have been for a long time, and like pulling out the wires to see what sparks.  Donations via Nexus are awesome and will result in a note of generous thanks.\n<br />\n<br />All donations go directly to an important cause: my personal gaming fund.  Your donations allow me to play better games, use more of my time to play them, and dedicate more of my energy to making cool mods for them.  (And yes, Fallout will always be my first love.)\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]AS ALWAYS..[/b]\n<br />========================================\n<br />\n<br />Thanks to my wife (Borderlands Assist Queen, fellow gamer, console girl, and partner in crime) for tolerating my Fallout fandom.\n<br />\n<br />Thanks to Eden, our yellow Labrador, who is currently away nursing her new puppies and being a good momma.  We miss her and look forward to her coming home.\n<br />\n<br />Thanks to everyone who has downloaded, enjoyed, and perhaps even endorsed any of my mods for Fallout 4 and New Vegas.  I write these weird little mods for myself, to try things out that hopefully keep the game interesting for me a little while longer, and it's nice to know that some of you good folks enjoy them, too.  I appreciate the kind words, support, and occasional gamer angst.\n<br />\n<br />I have no intention of porting any of my mods to console.  I'm a PC player, and diving into the Bethesda.net pool doesn't interest me in the least.\n<br />\n<br />This mod is still in regular development, meaning you should expect some bugs and items that need to be rebalanced.  Your game saves, however, should be fairly safe at this point.  Try it out and leave your feedback in the comments.  I want to hear them!\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]ABOUT ME[/b]\n<br />========================================\n<br />\n<br />[b]See my other Fallout 4 mods:[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/23558/?]Stash Those Caps[/url] - Makes caps truly portable again, just like in FO3/FNV\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/23269/?]Insult To Injury[/url] - Implements a working FNV-like limb damage/recovery system in Survival mode\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/22744/?]Companion Heal Thyself[/url] - Give companions the power to patch themselves\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/22585/?]Passive Aggressive Piper[/url] - Add affinity checks to Piper's more annoying, sarcastic and flirtatious comments\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/22434/?]Ferals After Dark[/url] - Makes feral ghouls a bit smarter and more dangerous after the sun goes down\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/22436/?]More Realistic Cats[/url] - Buffs the cat race to make them behave more like, well, cats\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/23498/?]Atomic Brahmin[/url] - When cows turn into mean, aggressive, highly unstable nuclear weapons\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/29957]Pack Attack[/url] - Mongrel dogs shift attack behavior based on social awareness and threat assessment",

Inside other objects, in water, even at air. Also makes almost all scrap-only objects (yellow) selectable/movable. Also you can move objects out of green zone and leave them there, while I do not recommend do this - if you think your settlement borders are too tight, just use border expanding mods like [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/3528/?]Build High[/url] (be careful though, as that mod conflicts with scrap mods and can cause reset bug).\n<br />\n<br />Allowing building in water has a side effect - all objects which requires water to be placed in, now can be build/placed everywhere also.\n<br />Put water-purifiers everywhere!\n<br />\n<br />You can [color=#00ff00][size=5]move workshop workbenches, power armors [/size][/color]and pretty much many other, previously unmovable objects (by default this mode is off - press INS to enable). Be careful, though, [color=#ff0000][size=4]save before moving/deleting such objects![/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Build restrictions (only in dirt, out of green zone) still there. The only problem is that objects with such restrictions (and all if outside workshop) will still be highlighted as able to build, but in fact they are not. You just have to remember - no building outside of green zone and if object says it has to be build in dirt, then so be it. You can build such objects in valid place first, then move them anywhere your like.\n<br />\n<br />You can toggle on/off out-of-workshop-zone timeout, so you can move built objects from your settlement as far as you like. Though, I'm not sure if placing settlement objects outside of settlement will not cause any issues, so do it on your own risk\n<br />\n<br />You can precise rotate objects by X, Y and Z axis via mouse buttons (default) or mouse wheel (see config option). Tapping ctrl key changes rotation axis. Numpad + and - changes rotation angle step.\n<br />You can precise move objects by X, Y and Z axis via numpad keys. 2,8 - up and down, 4,6 - left and right, 7,9 - to and from player. Numpad / and * changes movement step.\n<br />You can change scale of objects via numpad keys. 1 - scale down, 3 - scale up, . (dot) - reset scale to 100%. PgUp and PgDown changes scale step.\n<br />\n<br />You can make movable objects like armor, weapons, junk, e.t.c static (kannot be kicked and don't fall) and back. Default hotkeys - 'Home' turn object physics on (make it movable/droppable if possible), 'End' turn object physics off (make it static if possible).\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][center][color=#00ff00]For scaling, precise rotation and movement work, make sure object you want to move/rotate is just highlighted (outlined), NOT selected (floating in front of player).\n<br />For ANY numpad actions to work - check if NumLock is ON.[/color][/center][/size]\n<br />\n<br />Last 10 actions (precise movement/rotation/scaling) can be undone with Backspace key (default).\n<br />\n<br />You can save some object's parameters (position, rotation angles and scale) with '=' key and set all or some of this info to other objects. 1,2,3 - set X,Y,Z position, 4,5,6 - set X,Y,Z rotation angles, 7 - set scale, 0 - set all parameters.\n<br />\n<br />All hotkeyed actions shows notification when activated.\n<br />[size=4][color=#ffff00]ALL hotkeys and notification messages can be changed in config file ([/color][color=#00ff00]Data&#92;F4SE&#92;Plugins&#92;place.ini[/color][color=#ffff00])[/color]\n<br />[/size][color=#ffff00][size=4]If you don't have place.ini yet, rename [/size][/color][color=#00ff00][size=4]place_example.ini[/size][/color][color=#ffff00][size=4] to place.ini\n<br />[/size][/color][color=#ffff00][size=4]Information about what any option do can be found in [/size][/color][color=#00ff00][size=4]place_ini_help.txt[/size]\n<br />[/color]\n<br />\n<br />If you don't want any additional  features, except 'no-red' functionality - you can install one of predefined config files (see Misc section if Files).\n<br />\n<br />Look at changelog for latest changes.\n<br />\n<br />Be sure to visit [color=#00ff00][size=4]image gallery[/size][/color] - you'll see what can be done with this mod.

            "description": "[size=5][b]Summary[/b][/size]\n<br />\n<br />This mod attempts to vary the distribution of Power Armors throughout the game, as Bethesda has, once again, made one type of armor appear almost exclusively throughout the game, and it makes even less sense this time than it did in Fallout 3.\n<br />\n<br />This adjusts the leveled lists for all types of BOS, Atom Cats, and Military Power armor, which previously only existed for T-60, to use all 4 types of power armor (T-45, T-51, T-60, &amp; X-01). This means that every single member of the Brotherhood (except [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjPau5QYtYs]Paladin Safety Danse if we want to[/url]) and Atom Cats can spawn with any type of level appropriate power armor (and [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjPau5QYtYs]leave our friends behind[/url]) (except Raider).\n<br />\n<br />Thanks to [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/11234/?]Consistent Power Armor Overhaul[/url] (which is [b][u]required[/u][/b]), we have gorgeous paints for the non-T-60 armors, that mesh in perfectly with the default paints, for both the BOS and Atom Cats.\n<br />\n<br />I had to edit the T-45, T-51, and X-01 Power Armors in order to get them to apply the paints when added to the leveled lists. This means incompatibility with any other mods that edit the armor base forms. I have provided a patch for [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/7584/?]Impervious Power Armour[/url], as I personally use it. There aren't very many mods that conflict at the moment, so you should be pretty safe.\n<br />\n<br />They should spawn with armor of the correct rank as well. Knight-Captains will have armor painted for the rank and so on. Due to some serious fucking stupidity and laziness by Bethsoft, the random leveled grunts will not use ranked armor, and will just use knight painted armor. This isn't currently fixable, but I will do my best to fix it once the GECK descends to us mere mortals. Named NPC's should all use correctly painted armor though, so there's that.\n<br />\n<br />I have spent a good deal of time, trying to integrate this in the most compatible, and most seamless manner possible, I think I have gotten it working the best it can at the moment (due to the lack of GECK).\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][b]Features[/b][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Randomized Power Armor for all major factions, no more T-60 exclusivity\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[size=5][b]Requirements &amp; Compatibility[/b][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/11234/?]Consistent Power Armor Overhaul[/url] is awesome and [u]required[/u]\n<br />[*][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/6876/?]Armour Categories Re-done[/url] has a patch\n<br />[*][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/7584/?]Impervious Power Armour[/url] has a patch\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[size=5][b]Recommended Mods[/b][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]You might want to consider using [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/11978/?]Brotherhood Power Armor Overhaul[/url] instead\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[size=5][b]Other Links[/b][/size]\n<br />\n<br />If you would like to know what else I am working on, you can follow me on my [url=http://twitter.com/darthbdaman]Twitter[/url].

The function in question is ﻿[code]GetPrivateProfileString[/code], a relic of 16 bit operating systems. But do you know what is worse than using such a function? Using it hundreds of thousands of times.Apparently the game uses that function for every game setting individually, which means that the same ini file is opened and closed hundreds of times. What really makes this terrible is the fact that for each enabled plugin the game will attempt to read all the same settings from a hypothetical INI file that that plugin might or might not be loading. So you end up with an insane amount of incredibly inefficient calls for each enabled mod plugin. As a solution this mod will hook the functions involved and load the target INI files in memory so that each following call to the same INI file will be much faster as it will read directly from memory and will not require opening the file from scratch again.\n<br />\n<br />The amount of seconds that this mod will reduce your start time by depends on the amount of enabled plugins you have, as well as other things using INI files such as ENB (though ENB comes with it's own loading issues that this mod can't fix). It will be basically imperceptible when used on the vanilla game and will go up from there, shaving off 6 seconds for 50 or so plugins, up to 20+ seconds for 250+ plugins.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Solution[/b]\n<br />When the game, ENB or something else calls [code]GetPrivateProfileString[/code] first time this plugin will load requested file in memory and return required data. Next time, no file will be loaded and data will be fetched from memory as well. Same thing happens when process tries to write a value to file. Instead of opening file again, parse and save to disk the plugin will write data it to in-memory file and then saves to disk (if allowed). Also all files is saved on game close, if game won't crash in process.\n<br />\n<br />Plugin source is available on [url=https://github.com/KerberX/PrivateProfileRedirector]GitHub[/url].\n<br />\n<br />[s]Some problems such as infinite loading screen and weird camera FOV were reported.

Slightly slower performance if enabled.\n<br />With this enabled the ini files are sure to be saved even in case the game crashes for some reason.\n<br />Enabled by default.\n<br />[b]SaveOnWrite=1[/b]\n<br />\n<br />When 'SaveOnWrite' is enabled, this option sets maximum number of changes per file before they will be saved to disk.\n<br />For example, 'SaveOnWriteBuffer' is set to '3'. The game made two changes, they are saved in memory but not yet\n<br />saved to disk.

If your game starts from shortcut to main menu in split second then no. If it takes longer, this plugin can help. How much time you will save depends on your setup.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Q:[/b] Will this work with MO/NMM/Vortex/Kortex (yeah, I had to mention it) or any other mod manager?\n<br />[b]A:[/b] It was tested with MO2, Vortex and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/90868]Kortex[/url] and no problems was found. NMM have not been tested yet but are expected to work just fine. I can't say anything about compatibility with other mod managers.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Q:[/b] I've installed it and game crashes at startup (or you have any other problem).\n<br />[b]A:[/b] Enable log in config file and reproduce your crash. Go to [code]Data&#92;F4SE&#92;Plugins[/code], look for file [code]PrivateProfileRedirector.log[/code], zip it, upload it somewhere and post a link to it in your issue report. Log file can be more that 100 MB, so don't upload it as is, be sure to compress it.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Q:[/b] There is new version of Fallout 4 and/or F4SE, can I use this version with new game/F4SE version?\n<br />[b]A:[/b] Redirector itself doesn't need Script Extender to function. The only thing that depends on F4SE is overriding of \"RefreshINI\" console command to reload files from disk to update cached INI files. If you load Redirector without F4SE or with newer or older version of F4SE the Redirector will not override \"RefreshINI\" but still will function as usual. So [b]you can use this plugin with any game and F4SE version[/b].\n<br />\n<br />If you absolutely need \"RefreshINI\" command to work with this plugin and I haven't had time to update it, you can disable Script Extender version check in [code]PrivateProfileRedirector.ini[/code] file. Open it, find option [code]AllowSEVersionMismatch[/code] and change its value to [code]1[/code].\n<br />\n<br />Thanks to everyone who helped test the plugin, especially AL12 and Augh.",

I mean, your going to be fighting them ALL THE TIME. This mod adds various headwear and armor in the game that appear wilder, more savage, more \"raider-esque\". Also included are consumables, new power armor, dog gear and equipment modifications, designed to reflect the savagery and carelessness of the raider faction. This mod requires the AWCKR mod, and nearly everything is CBBE compatable. Every piece included (except the raider mod armor retexture) is 100% standalone and no vanilla textures have been replaced in any way. Raiders and their dogs in your game will randomly spawn with n new or armor. You may even meet a Raider Dreadnaught up close!\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff0000][size=5]WARNING: This mod makes raiders tougher (duh)[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />If you like my Power Armor, but dont want the rest of my mod, check out [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/13552/?]Mad Max's Raider Power Armor Chop-Shop[/url]\n<br />\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/15/?]CBBE[/url] compatable.\n<br />\n<br />KKTheBeast has made [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/14182/?]VIS[/url] patches for this mod.\n<br />\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/6091/?tab=1&amp;navtag=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Ffallout4%2Fajax%2Fmoddescription%2F%3Fid%3D6091%26preview%3D&amp;pUp=1]Armor and Weapons Keyword Community Resource[/url] is required to use this mod.\n<br />\n<br />I have also included a download, [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/10962/?]Raider Armor Buff[/url] that adds a little defense to raider armor.\n<br />\n<br />There's also the [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/11853/?]Super Mutant Redux[/url]\n<br />\n<br />Dont forget there is now [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/5028/?]Better Armor Mod Descriptions[/url] support!\n<br />\n<br />Featured on [url=http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/user/6083674-haoswidasee/]Haoswidasee[/url]'s [url=http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/3642835-ultimate-fallout-4-mod-compilation-100-working-mods-with-installation-instructions/]Ultimate Fallout Mod Compilation[/url]!\n<br />\n<br />Hable Espanol: [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/15915?]Raider Overhaul WIP with Spanish Translation[/url]\n<br />[line][center][b][font=Tahoma][color=#ffd966][size=4][img]http://i67.tinypic.com/28bs5j8.png[/img][/size][/color][/font][/b][/center][list]\n<br />[*][b][font=Tahoma][color=#ffd966][size=4][/size][/color][/font][/b]\n<br />[*][font=Trebuchet MS][size=2][color=#f6b26b][/color][/size][/font]\n<br />[*][b][font=Tahoma][color=#ffd966][size=4]Weapons [/size][/color][/font][/b]\n<br />[*][font=Trebuchet MS][size=2][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/10771/?]Mad Can: Fury Beans (Can Cudgel)[/url][/size][/font]\n<br />[*][font=Trebuchet MS][size=2][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/11117/?tab=4&amp;navtag=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Ffallout4%2Fajax%2Fcomments%2F%3Fthread_id%3D3922275%26mod_id%3D11117]Crowbar[/url][/size][/font]\n<br />[*][font=Trebuchet MS][size=2][color=#f6b26b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/12102/?]Murdering Chainsaw[/url][/color][/size][/font]\n<br />[*][font=Trebuchet MS][size=2][color=#f6b26b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/11142/?]Slaughtering Buzz Axe[/url][/color][/size][/font]\n<br />[*][font=Trebuchet MS][size=2][color=#f6b26b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/16657/?]Crude Blowback[/url][/color][/size][/font]\n<br />[*][font=Trebuchet MS][size=2][color=#f6b26b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/18457/?]Handmade Revolver[/url][/color][/size][/font]\n<br />[*][font=Trebuchet MS][size=2][color=#f6b26b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/17335/?]Concrete Sledgehammer[/url][/color][/size][/font]\n<br />[*][font=Trebuchet MS][size=2][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/10826/?]Pipe [/url][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/10826/?]Shotgun [/url][/size][/font]\n<br />[*][size=2][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/11274/?]Standalone Pipe Shotgun[/url][/size]                                    \n<br />[*][font=Trebuchet MS][size=2]Chopper Pipe Rifle Mod[/size][/font]\n<br />[*][font=Trebuchet MS][size=2]H.A.T.E.

This (very) heavy Raider upgrade is one tier higher than buttressed armor. It sports impressive stats, on par with Heavy Combat Armor. The Dreadnaught set is layered in vibrant, contrasting colors to attract enemies, and bring WAR. You'll instantly know where to focus your attention, as will your enemies when your wearing this fortress of undiluted awesome! Completely compatible with all linings, renaming, and fully integrated into the game. With this set I've included a custom fitted Dreadnaught Helmet, as fearsome as it is defensive. Also there's a new outfit to compliment the set, the Tar Walker Outfit, garb peeled from the oily hands of the infamous Tar Walkers from a secluded, ruined city called Filla Delphia.[size=2]\n<br />\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[center][line]\n<br />[img]http://i65.tinypic.com/jhvggp.png[/img]\n<br />The forged have a whole new look and feel. And a big defense boost to boot. Ive added custom armors for the forged that will only spawn on them. There are 5 variants:[/center][list]\n<br />[*]Forged Subaltern Outfit\n<br />[*]Forged Factotum Outfit\n<br />[*]Forged Abettor Armor\n<br />[*]Forged Despot Armor\n<br />[*]Forged Magnate Armor\n<br />[/list]Each variant has slightly more defense and fire resistance than the previous. 3 of the outfits can be crafted in the AWKCR Armor Station, however the other 2 variants must be looted from the forged themselves. Furthermore, the forged will now spawn with crowbars and shiskebabs in addition to their flamers.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff0000] IMPORTANT[/color]: This update doesnt make the forged OP in any way, however it does make them tougher. I highly suggest you take the time to outfit the settlers at the Slog. Giving your settlers better guns and armor will give them a much easier time against the tougher Forged.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center][img]http://i67.tinypic.com/t9cny8.jpg[/img][color=#f6b26b][color=#e1e1e1][size=5][img]http://i65.tinypic.com/30ijb0g.png[/img][/size][/color][/color]\n<br />[size=2]With this mod the Raider Power Armor has gotten a complete overhaul, every power armor mod, including jetpacks, 8 new paints, each with their own benefits, full leveled list integration, so it can be found throughout the Commonwealth. It still has less defense that other PA variants, but it has a great amount of health, and can be repaired with some steel and duct tape. Expect raider bosses to battle in tricked out custom power armor rigs![/size]\n<br />[line][/center][center][img]http://i65.tinypic.com/2jfejps.png[/img][/center][img]http://i64.tinypic.com/2hhn0i1.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />The Junkyard Dog Armor(s) come in light, medium and heavy variants, all of which are much heavier than vanilla dog armor, but offer far more protection, without breaking immersion. The armor will NOT make DogMeat invincible, but it will make him more resilient. I gave them some energy resistance since the majority of the armor is metal.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff0000] IMPORTANT NOTE[/color]: this upgraded defense can make raider mongrels fairly tough, but they wont spawn with any armor at low levels and their damage output remains the same. Just be prepared if you see a raider mongrel rushing at you with this armor on.\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][color=#ffd966][b][size=3]Heavy Junkyard Dog Ar[/size][/b][b][size=3]mor[/size][/b][/color]\n<br />[/list]   [size=2]-15 Units of weight\n<br />   -60 Damage Resistance\n<br />   -30 Energy Resistance[/size][list]\n<br />[*][b][color=#ffd966][size=3]Medium Junkyard Dog Armor[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />[/list]   -10 Units of Weight\n<br />   -40 Damage Resistance\n<br />   -20 Energy Resistance[list]\n<br />[*][b][color=#ffd966][size=3]Light Junkyard Dog Armor[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />[/list]   -5 Units os Weight\n<br />   -20 Damage Resistance\n<br />   -10 Energy Resistance\n<br />[line]\n<br />\n<br />Download [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/6091/?tab=1&amp;navtag=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Ffallout4%2Fajax%2Fmoddescription%2F%3Fid%3D6091%26preview%3D&amp;pUp=1]Armor and Weapons Keyword Community Resource[/url] first.\n<br />Then download with the NMM, or you can manually install, unzip and Copy into your Data folder.

This issue is exemplified in the raider faction which will attack the player regardless of what the player does.This mod will allow the player to infiltrate raider camps assuming he can either avoid patrols or talk his way in.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />What this mod adds.\r<br />-All raiders neutral as standard\r<br />-All raider area containers both interior and exterior are now owned by raiders - no stealing&#33;\r<br />-Raider crime faction that will make the player hostile for 24 hours if they upset a group of raiders.\r<br />-All raiders have guard packages that will warn you off and attack if you dawdle too long.\r<br />- Unique lookout npcs that will challenge the player [u]if detected[/u]. The raider will have opportunities in dialogue to talk his way past the guard but if he fails or runs off then the lookout will trigger a nearby siren.\r<br />-lookouts have 3 sets of random dialogue (unvoiced)\r<br />-Sirens are placed in virtually every raider interior/ exterior as are lookouts who often have guard dog followers.\r<br />-4 unique raider npcs with location based dialogue that will give you the opportunity to talk your way into an area.\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;m looking to add to and continue working on this mod over time especially if people like it. \r<br />First port of call would be getting some voice actors who sound like they fit in with the fallout 4 raiders&#33;\r<br />I am also considering adding more unique raider quests and adding more facets to the raider camps like caged guard dogs that are released by the alarms and perhaps reinforcements&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />UPDATES:  The dialogue was wonky and was not working as intended. This should be solved now in the latest version of the mod&#33; I have added blank dialogue as a placeholder which means you can skip dialogue if you want to. I&#39;ve added Lilly into Corvega interior now. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />REQUIREMENTS: Turn on your subtitles because dialogue is currently unvoiced. No dlc or mod requirements.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Conflicts : Nothing unless it changes the raider actor ai I believe",

From Skyrim to Fallout! Because fallout deserves immersion as well!\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]Ever wondered why [/size][/font][font=Verdana][size=3][font=Verdana][size=3]NPC's [/size][/font]always seems to have a longer pause between each sentence? Well No more, They are actually talking like people should do now.\n<br />Every social logic in Fallout for [font=Verdana][size=3]NPC's[/size][/font] is changed, they talk more often to each others. And will less likely greet to you from a distance, they will also greet less often too, making them to not act as much as robots. [font=Verdana][size=3]NPC's[/size][/font] are also more clever and will know for example if they talked to a [font=Verdana][size=3]NPC [/size][/font]and will therefore talk to another or not talk at all. After some time, they talk again with each others.\n<br />Expressions is also overhauled, they express themselves when they actually should. \n<br />Emotions is as well overhauled, You can see how the [font=Verdana][size=3]NPC's[/size][/font] face look more alive.\n<br />The time when NPC's eats is overhauled as well, now NPC's will eat at a more regular time like lunch: 12-1pm, Dinner 4-5pm. Player will comment more when skipping a dialogue and much much more!\n<br />\n<br />Additionally, I included the option to increase the amount of active NPC's at one cell. It doesn't magically add more NPC's it just makes it possible, so enjoy visiting your settlements with many NPC's or running into a battlefield with a huge amount of NPC's fighting.\n<br />\n<br />Did you accidentally run in to some stuff, and [/size][/font][font=Verdana][size=3][font=Verdana][size=3]NPC's [/size][/font]start to yell at you?\n<br />Well it won't happen as often now, It happen way too often in vanilla.\n<br />\n<br />This is a must-have mod for anyone that has sound on while playing.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][b]What it covers:[/b][/size]\n<br />[size=3]This covers all talking/singing [font=Verdana][size=3]NPC's[/size][/font] ( also new modded [font=Verdana][size=3]NPC's[/size][/font] ), no matter what language you have.\n<br />Also covers modded sentences.\n<br />[/size][size=6]\n<br />[b]Compatibility:[/b][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[/font][list]\n<br />[size=3][font=Verdana]Any mod actually. \n<br />[/font][/size][/list][font=Verdana]\n<br />[size=5][b]Savegame compatible and clean:[/b][/size]\n<br />[size=3]The mod is savegame compatible and is also safe to uninstall.\n<br />[b]This mod is completely script free.[/b][/size]\n<br />[size=5]\n<br />[b]Install:[/b][/size]\n<br />[size=3]Choose one of the Main files or one from the optional files.\n<br />Activate with your mod manager[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[/font][font=Verdana][size=4][b]My other Fallout 4 mods:[/b][/size]\n<br />[size=3][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/145/?]Fallout Texture Overhaul Stars\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/160?]Fallout Texture Overhaul Moons\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/449/?]Fallout Texture Overhaul PipBoy (Pip-Boy) UHD 4K\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/3344]Fallout Texture Overhaul Power Armors UHD 4K\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/32246]Fallout water overhaul[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/32255]Fallout Texture Overhaul Radscorpions 4K[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/32334]Fallout Texture Overhaul Mole rats 4K[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/32514]Realistic Conversations Fallout 4[/url][/size][color=#ffffff][size=3][u][b]\n<br />\n<br />[/b][/u][b][size=6][b]Permissions:[/b][/size]\n<br />[size=3]This mod is made by Gorgulla and is ONLY allowed to be uploaded by Gorgulla on either Nexusmods or Bethesda.\n<br />If you find it elsewhere, IT'S STOLEN.\n<br />You are not allowed to change my mod and upload it as your own.[/size][/b][/size][/color]\n<br />[/font]",

Configurable service charge and health restore options.\n<br />[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ff00][center][size=3][ all Papyrus scripts are digitally remastered in full 4K UHD with 7.1 surround ] [/size][/center][/color]\n<br />[size=3] \n<br />Install this mod at any time in any game stage for any game difficulty (including survival) and the player is given a regenerating [color=#00ff00][ .SKK pLAYERuNDEAD ] [/color]menu item in AID inventory after exiting V111 (craft spares at the Chemlab). When the item is activated, a menu pops for:\n<br />\n<br /> \n<br />Service state: [ Enable | Disable ]\n<br />Service fee: [ 0% | 50% | 100% ] of player caps.\n<br />Restore [ 10% | 50% | 100% ]  of player health.\n<br /> \n<br /> \n<br />[b]User Notes (RTFM)\n<br />[/b]\n<br />When PlayerUndead™ is enabled, the player is configured to be essential with no bleedout recovery (like a companion) so they don't actually die.\n<br />\n<br />After bleeding out the player can chose to recover in place or to the nearest owned workshop (that is not being attacked by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/37393]Settlement Attack System[/url]).\n<br />\n<br />If there are no registered owned workshops in the worldspace or interior, the player is recovered to Sanctuary because ownership of that workshop should never be lost. If Sanctuary is a hostile Conquerer settlement, that's on you.\n<br />\n<br />If the player has a companion using the standard companion slot who is also bleeding out, they are moved with the player so they don't try to bail and return to their home location.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]Known Issues[/b]\n<br />\n<br />(1) If the player dies whilst in VATS the imagespace animations freeze and death can not be recovered. Reload from save. \n<br />\n<br />(2) In some areas of the world bad surface/navmesh can cause the \"[i]player the bleeding out on the ground[/i]\" idle animation to fall through the world, or the 3rd person camera to become stuck. Reload from save.\n<br />\n<br />(3) When actors are bleeding out they are actually marked as dead so they are no longer attacked. This can cause other actors to loot their weapons and ammo during bleedout. If your stuff is not on a dead hostile, check your companion.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]Compatibility\n<br />\n<br />[/b](1) The mod has no dependencies on extenders or DLCs. \n<br />\n<br />(2) There is one change to a base game asset: MGEF [font=Courier New]RestoreRadsCompanion[/font] to avoid Stimpaks healing rads on the player whilst they are essential. It will conflict with anything that modifies the effect.\n<br />\n<br />(3) If the mod detects that the player is already essential when the [color=#00ff00][ .SKK pLAYERuNDEAD ] [/color]menu item is activated, it will pop a warning message that it can't continue. Things known to already manage the player essential state are Death Matters, Horizon, Follower Revive System, Zombie Walkers and Fallout 4-76 PlayerUndead™ option.\n<br />\n<br />(4) This mod should be compatible with multiple companion/follower mods if you use the \"recover in place\" option. It will not be compatible if you use the \"recover to nearest workshop option\" as it doesn't know about the additional headcount to manage their bleedout state and move them with the player.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[/size][size=3][b]PC Console configuration[/b][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]If additional inventory items trigger you, no problem throw it away and use the console, hotkeys.ini or create an MCM json thing:[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[font=Courier New][size=2]set SKK_PUEnabled to 1       ;; options [0 | 1]\n<br />set SKK_PUCapsCharge to 0    ;; range [0 to 1] decimal percent of player total caps. \n<br />set SKK_PURestoreHealth to 1 ;; range [0.1 to 1] decimal percent of player total health (do not set to zero).\n<br />cqf SKK_PUQuest \"SKK_PUQuestScript.SwitchPlayerUndead\" ;; call this for enable/disable to take effect[/size][/font]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]\n<br />[b]Nexus PC manual installation &amp; disable\n<br />\n<br />[/b]Copy SKKPlayerUndead.esp and  SKKPlayerUndead – Main.BA2 to your...&#92;Fallout 4&#92;Data directory and add to Plugins.txt, or enable in the Bethesda mod menu, use a mod manger or however you organise. \n<br />\n<br />Do not disable this mod if the service state is enabled, but when the service state is disabled the mod is idle and can be disabled in the load order. Only remove mods if you are happy to accept potential conflicts from load order changes in a save game. If that is unclear, best to be safe and don't ever remove mods from a savegame.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]Nexus FAQ[/b]\n<br />\n<br />(1) Why is there no ESL version ? Because life already contains sufficient hassle. \n<br />\n<br />(2) Why an aid item menu rather than MCM ? Because 90% of SKK mod users like to shoot stuff on Xbox.\n<br />\n<br />(3) It has been decided to not merge this function into [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/37963]SKK Dynamic Damage Manager[/url] because reasons.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ff00](4) Holdon pal, isn't this just a rip and republish of a feature from your massive [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/32599]Fallout 4-76 Open World[/url] overhaul mod ? Why Timmy, yes that's quite right ! Mainly because I need a lightweight no death solution based on scripts I trust more than your mommy when I am not in the 4-76 open world, but also a 4K UHD remaster of the original Papyrus scripts must be worth publishing standalone just like those HD nipples and 4K scrotum re-textures.

            "description": "[size=3]Monitor workshop access by NPC actors and configure the automatic return of weapons, ammo and legendaries looted by them.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Install this non intrusive mod at any time in any game, as it makes no static changes to your game at all. After waking in V111 cryo or moving in the Commonwealth the player is given a regenerating [ [color=#00ff00].SKK Workshop Access Monitor [/color]] aid item for menu configuration and commands (craft replacements in the chemlab).  \n<br />\n<br />The ability for NPC actors to loot containers to upgrade weapons (based on value or dps no one really knows) and ammo during combat is hard coded into the game engine, which can become hassle if you run a lot of workshop attacks. This solution detects NPC actors accessing your player owned workshops to enforce your policy.\n<br />\n<br />Update 003 includes a central weapon stash for settler returns &amp; upgrades, with access activators which can be crafted (furniture/containers) at each workshop. If one is present, settlers will use the central stash rather than the workshop to return and upgrade weapons when commanded. [i][b][color=#00ff00]This means you can still manage upgrades when access to the workshop is blocked.[/color][/b][/i]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]Menu Options\n<br />[/b]\n<br />(1) Open all workshop actor and follower inventories [ go ]\n<br />\n<br />(2) Return all weapons/ammo &amp; upgrade to the best [ go ]\n<br />\n<br />(3) Include active Followers in return all weapons [[color=#00ff00] *OFF[/color] | ON ] \n<br />\n<br />(4) Workshop Monitor [ [color=#00ff00]*Enable[/color] | Disable ] \n<br />\n<br />(5) Take weapons [ [color=#00ff00]*Enable [/color]| Disable ] \n<br />\n<br />(6) Return excess ammo  [ [color=#00ff00]*Enable[/color] | Disable ] \n<br />\n<br />(7) Legendary warning   [[color=#00ff00] *Enable[/color] | Disable ] \n<br />\n<br />(8) Wasteland Justice [ Enable |[color=#00ff00] *Disable [/color]] \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]Menu Option Details [/b]\n<br />\n<br />(1) [[color=#00ff00] Open all actor inventories [/color]] will open in sequence all player followers and local workshop assigned actors to find any other theaving. Companions (active and dismissed) are the WORST for grabbing and keeping extra weapons and ammo from corpses and containers during combat.\n<br />\n<br />(2) When in an owned workshop location the [ [color=#00ff00]Return all weapons/ammo &amp; upgrade to best[/color] ] option will transfer any droppable base game/DLC weapon and ammo from organic humanoid (Human, Ghoul, Synth, Supermutant) workshop actors and player followers to the local workshop (if workshop access is allowed) or central stash (if a local activator is built). Actors that do not have a recognised weapon or have animations for regular weapons are excluded (Alien, Robots &amp; etc). Supermutants can only use Pipe, Assault, Hunting and Minigun weapons. \n<br />\n<br />(3) Companion actors are never included in the automatic upgrade process to avoid their undroppable/inventory invisible default weapon from being removed and lost forever.\n<br />\n<br />(4) The active workshop monitor must be enabled enabled to unlok the following functions: \n<br />\n<br />(5) Block weapons &amp; ammo being taken. This will not help with actors scavenging wepons off the ground or looting corpses during combat, but [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/34693]Combat Settlers[/url]﻿ can manage that battlefield scavenging, fully compatible with this monitor for total loot coverage. If Combat Settlers is installed and its Mange Weapons function is enabled, this Take Weapons is LOCKED enabled/allowed.\n<br />\n<br />(6) If not allowed to take weapons, still return excess ammo (because actors always take the whole stack) except the 1 round they actually need. \n<br />\n<br />(7) If allowed to take weapons, warn if a legendary has been taken and optionally pop the actor inventory to retrieve it. This does not automatically return legendary weapons to avoid blocking loops where actors are allowed to upgrade weapons from the workshop, but keep trying to take the same highest value legendary that keeps getting returned. \n<br />\n<br />(8) With update 002 if actors are not allowed to take weapons, Wastleand Justice can be enforced. Any workshop thief that is not a quest target, unique or a companion actor is kicked from the workshop, made mortal and hostile. Sort them out. Check the corpse for stolen loot to clear the holding marker so it can be cleaned up.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]Known Issues[/b]\n<br />\n<br />(1) The automatic [ [color=#00ff00]Return all weapons/ammo[/color] ... ] functions can occasionally trigger actors to reset to their default ActorBase outfit if you have equipped non standard clothes/armor. This outfit reset is a base game defect triggered by script functions RemoveItem(Weapon), AddItem(Weapon) and comically EquipItem(Armor) when trying to fix the issue by automatically re-equipping armor. Even the official high quality supported Creation Club content has this problem.\n<br />\n<br />(2) Best weapon is defined in the priority order of FormList [font=Courier New]SKK_WAMWeaponListUpgrade [/font]which can be editied before a game starts, but not once a game is running as DLC weapons are automatically added to the top of the list which will be lost.\n<br />\n<br />(3) This automatically includes most DLC weapons/ammo if installed, but clearly does not know about your mod added weapons/ammo. They can be added to [font=Courier New]SKK_WAMWeaponListUser and [font=Courier New]SKK_WAMAmmoListUser [/font][/font]with xEdit at any time (best to save an an over-ride file) to be included in the main lists. Once added DO NOT REMOVE ENTRIES as this will corrupt the lists with NULL holes. \n<br />\n<br />(4) Grenades and particularly mines are excluded from the weapons lists as they can cause problems with scripted interactions. If you are feeling lucky you can try adding them to [font=Courier New]SKK_WAMWeaponListUser[/font] and see what happens. Boom.\n<br />\n<br />[b]\n<br />Compatibility[/b]\n<br />\n<br />The mod has no dependencies on extenders or DLCs and does not change any existing base game scripts, assets or objects. It is 100% pure new Creation Kit forms and scripts which means that it has no load order dependencies.\n<br />\n<br />As this mod was published after November 2019 it depends on Fallout4.exe 1.10.162.0 (or later). \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]Nexus PC manual installation &amp; disable[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Copy SKKWorkshopAccessMonitor.esp and  SKKWorkshopAccessMonitor – Main.BA2 to your...&#92;Fallout 4&#92;Data directory and add to Plugins.txt, or enable in the Bethesda mod menu, use a mod manger or however you organise. \n<br />\n<br />If [ [color=#00ff00]Workshop Monitor Disable [/color]] is set in the menu no scripts will be active so the mod can be disabled in the load order if you have removed any built weapons stash activators. Only remove mods if you are happy to accept potential conflicts from load order changes in a save game.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]Nexus FAQ[/b]\n<br />\n<br />(1) But I can stop settlers taking my stuff with seperate non accessible/locked containers or keeping all my stuff in workshops with no settlers ! Absolutley if you actually enjoy that stuff micromanagement then keep on fiddling. Clearly this QOL solution was not created for you, try Fallout 76 which contains 101% maintenance grind and inventory micromanagement.\n<br />\n<br />(2) But I am using your allegedly settler proof Global Stash ! When the player is building all the global stash inventory is transferred to the local workshop, so settlers CAN infact get their grubby little paws on your sweet sweet stuff if there is any combat whilst you are building. \n<br />\n<br />(3) Why is there no ESL version ? Because life already contains sufficient hassle maintaining 50 scripted ESP solutions. \n<br />\n<br />(4) Will this be merged the other mainstream SKK workshop/settler solutions like Workshop Ownership Utilities or Combat Settlers to reduce mod slots ? Possibly.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]Console Configuration for default settings[/b][/size]\n<br />[font=Courier New][size=2]\n<br />set SKK_WAMEnableMonitor    to 1 ;[0|1] disable | enable.\n<br />set SKK_WAMAllowWeapons     to 1; [0|1] disable | enable.\n<br />set SKK_WAMReturnAmmo       to 1; [0|1] disable | enable.\n<br />set SKK_WAMLegendaryWarning to 1; [0|1] disable | enable.\n<br />set SLL_WAMIncludeFollowers to 0; [0|1] disable | enable.\n<br />set SKK_WAMWastelandJustice to 0; [0|1] disable | enable.\n<br />\n<br />cqf SKK_WAMQuest \"SKK_WAMQuestScript.RegisterWorkshops\" ; Function to implement changes \n<br />[/size][/font][font=Courier New][size=2]\n<br />cqf SKK_WAMQuest \"SKK_WAMQuestScript.OpenInventories\" 8DigitWorkshopREF  \n<br />cqf SKK_WAMQuest \"SKK_WAMQuestScript.ReturnWeapons\" 8DigitWorkshopREF [/size][/font]",

If any masochists out there want a patch that will let the unique or named pieces get wrecked too, let me know.\n<br /> \n<br />I recommend using this on a new playthrough, to get the full effect of the changes to loot and weapon upgrades.\n<br />For an existing game: if you are wearing PA in your savegame, EXIT YOUR ARMOR, make a new save, and THEN activate this mod.

Mister Undertaker, an early prototype model, was quietly introduced a short while later.\n<br />\n<br />Mister Rescue met with commercial success and was subsequently marketed to consumers as Mister GroundsKeeper in 2045 with notable sales revenue from golf courses, vacation resorts, and daycare centers.\n<br />\n<br />2055 saw the release of Mister Salvage &amp; Reclamation (later rebranded \"Mister Salvage\").  Revenue for this Type-1d model was modest with purchase orders primarily from construction and landscaping firms.\n<br />\n<br />That same year, the Vault-Tec Corporation acquired exclusive rights for a Mister Tidy Type-1e model (essentially a redesign of the Mister Undertaker prototype) which was subsequently deployed at Vault-Tec's numerous facilities.[/size][/i]\n<br />\n<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[/center]\n<br />[b][size=3][color=lightgreen]Key Features:[/color][/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />• Automatic Operation\n<br />• Limited to One per Settlement\n<br />• Continues working while its Cell is unloaded\n<br />• Recovered items are transferred to the Station Pad's chest\n<br />• Waits at the station pad when there is currently nothing to tidy\n<br />• Tidying requires wall-clock time and is not affected by Wait, Sleep, or Fast Travel\n<br />• The content of Mr Tidy's chest can be extracted using a Vacuum Hopper (Contraptions Workshop DLC)\n<br />\n<br />This mod provides a \"lore friendly\" approach for removing corpses and other dead things from a settlement by enabling you to assign that task to a Vault-Tec [color=lightblue][b]Mister Tidy[/b][/color] robot.  Just place the 'bot in a central area, instruct it to begin tidying, wait a minute for it to \"beep\" (or makes cheerful noises when there is nothing to tidy up), and then feel free to resume your adventures.\n<br />\n<br />Mr. Tidy can be directed to tidy things within the boundaries of that settlement, or for a distance that can extend beyond those boundaries, with tidying always centered on its station pad.  Mr. Tidy returns to the station pad upon completion.  It then waits there until it is instructed to resume, or is stored in its workshop, or is scrapped.  Items recovered from corpses are stored in the station pad's chest.\n<br />\n<br />There is a brief initial mission / quest which provides a bit of backstory and conveys essential usage information.  It normally begins after escaping from Vault 111.  For those using an \"alternate start\" mod, it begins while outdoors in the Commonwealth (the main game area) -- or try visiting Sanctuary Hills and stand near the Workshop for a few minutes.\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=white]NOTE:[/color][/size][/b]  This is a mod for removing dead things, but which also automatically collects items for you from those dead things. It is not intended to be just a looting mod. So players who do not desire dead things to be removed (perhaps because of the behavior of some other mod) should simply not use Mr Tidy.\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=white]ANOTHER NOTE:[/color][/size][/b]  Create a saved game before tidying a settlement -- one that you can return to if issues are encountered.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=lightgreen]How To Build:[/color][/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />Mister Tidy is placed in a settlement by using a WorkShop to build a Station Pad.  The station pad can be found in the STRUCTURES&gt;MISCELLANEOUS section of the WorkShop's building menu when an initial quest (\"Rest In Peace\") is completed.  The quest appears shortly after leaving Vault 111 for normal play, or when outdoors in the Commonwealth when using an \"alternate start\" mod. If the quest does not appear when expected, then double-check to confirm that this mod has been enabled.\n<br />\n<br />When opening a workshop to build something, you initially see the user interface positioned at a wooden building with \"Structures\" as a label above it. Go upwards one row from there, and then go over to the right along that row until you see \"Structures&gt;Miscellaneous\" as a label; in the base game that label is above a bloodied super mutant pole but may be something different depending on the mods you installed. Now go up one row from there. Everything you then see horizontally in that row is the \"Structures&gt;Miscellaneous\" subcategory. In that row will be the Mister Tidy Station Pad; perhaps as the very first item.\n<br />\n<br />It is best to position the Station Pad on the ground in the central area of a settlement in such a way that Mister Tidy will have easy access to places within the settlement's boundaries.\n<br />\n<br />If you are not able to find the\"Structures&gt;Miscellaneous\" subcategory, then you installed a mod that alters the basic construction categories of the game. In which case you may not be able to build the Station Pad, and hence will not be able to use this mod -- if you are lucky, the conflicting mod may have simply rearranged items, with the Station Pad now residing elsewhere in some other category or subcategory instead of where it was intended to be.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=lightgreen]Tidying Up:[/color][/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />Mr. Tidy automatically removes the following \"remains\" and stores any recovered items that they may have contained in the station pad's Chest:\n<br />\n<br />• Corpses\n<br />• Dead Things\n<br />• Skeletons\n<br />• Bone Fragments\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=lightgreen]Mr. Tidy Status:[/color][/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />Mr. Tidy's station pad has colored indicators which identify the bot's current status:\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=yellow]Yellow[/color][/b]  --  Mr. Tidy has not yet been activated.  Interact with the station pad to begin tidying.  The colored indicators will then become Blue.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=lightblue]Blue[/color][/b]  --  Mr.Tidy is currently gathering cleanup information.  The player should remain in the settlement while the indicators are Blue.  When the cleanup information has been collected, the indicators will become Green if there are \"remains\" to be tidied, or will become White if there is no work to be done.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=lightgreen]Green[/color][/b]  --  Mr. Tidy is currently analyzing cleanup information or actively traveling around to tidy things up.  Mr. Tidy will Beep when the indicators become Green.  The bot will now be able to continue tidying while the player is away from the settlement.  The indicators will become White when cleanup has been completed.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=white]White[/color][/b]  --  Mr. Tidy is currently idle while waiting to begin the next tidying cycle.  This is the time to store (or scrap) a settlement's Mr. Tidy when its job is completed.  Tidying is resumed by interacting with the station pad.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=lightgreen]Scan Range:[/color][/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />The scan range for both \"long range\" and \"within settlement boundaries\" is 10,000 units of game-world distance.  So the difference between those choices is simply whether particular remains are processed (inside the bounds) or not (outside the bounds) when Mr Tidy's station pad is positioned in a settlement's central area.  Short Range is 3,500 units.  Medium Range is 6,000 units.\n<br />\n<br />10,000 units is far enough to span the interior of base-game settlements when Mr Tidy's station pad is centrally positioned.  I have never used the DLCs so do not know the coverage for their settlements.  And of course coverage will vary when using mods that alter settlement boundaries or add new settlements.\n<br />\n<br />As an example, just over the bridge from Sanctuary there is initially a dead NPC and a dead dog.  They are outside Sanctuary's settlement boundary and so are never processed when using \"within settlement boundaries\", but are processed when using \"long range\" with Mr Tidy's station pad positioned near Sanctuary's workshop.  The distance from that workshop to the corpses is approximately 8,500 units.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=lightgreen]Installation:[/color][/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />Install using a mod manager, or unpack the mod and copy the .ESP/.ESL and .BA2 files into the game's &#92;DATA folder, then enable the mod.\n<br />\n<br />Position this mod's .ESP/.ESL file to be as low as it will go in your \"Load Order\" sequence.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=lightgreen]Install ESP or ESL?[/color][/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />If you are reaching the maximum allowed number of .ESP installs, and want to install more mods, then install the .ESL versions of those new mods ...\n<br />\n<br />Back-in-the-day, many players were reaching the maximum number of allowed .ESP installs, so Bethesda introduced a way to permit more via .ESL files.\n<br />\n<br />The Light Master (.ESL) file is an optimized file format introduced in the Fallout 4 v1.10 update. Using Light Master files allows more plugins (mods and patch mods) to be installed than previously possible with .ESP files. For .ESP files there is a limit of 255, whereas a maximum of 4096 .ESL files can be loaded (but in practice is difficult to achieve due to other technical constraints).\n<br />\n<br />Both file types can be used together, which means you can install just .ESP files if your install count remains below the .ESP maximum, or just .ESL files if your count remains below the .ESL maximum, or some of both such as using .ESP files initially and then adding .ESL files thereafter when the maximum for .ESP has been reached.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=lightgreen]ESP/ESL Compatibility:[/color][/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />Saved games that currently use an .ESP mod are not compatible with an .ESL of that same mod. Similarly, saved games that are currently using the .ESL for a mod are not compatible with an .ESP of that same mod.  That is a basic game restriction in terms of switching between .ESP and .ESL versions of a mod.  There is no \"fix\" or workaround -- it is inherent in the game's design.\n<br />\n<br />So, to switch from .ESP to .ESL, or from .ESL to .ESP, you must:\n<br />\n<br />1 ) uninstall the mod\n<br />2 ) load the current saved game\n<br />3 ) create a new saved game (while that mod is not installed)\n<br />4 ) install the other download of that mod\n<br />5 ) resume play with that newly created saved game\n<br />\n<br />Objects and NPCs provided by the mod will not be there now and must be created once more. Similarly, quests will need to be done again.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=lightgreen]Requirements:[/color][/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />No special requirements.  DLCs are not needed.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=lightgreen]Known Issues:[/color][/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />The game can be a bit quirky at times, which can result in an NPC becoming a bit confused (or even stuck) when traveling from one place to another.  When this happens for a Mr. Tidy, it automatically performs \"fast travel\" (teleports) back to its Station Pad.  So if you are watching Mr. Tidy, and it suddenly disappears, it has returned to its Station Pad and resumes its tidying activities from there.\n<br />\n<br />Mister Tidy, by necessity, uses a pathing mechanism that is less robust and more error prone than the one that NPCs and other Robots typically use.  As a result, Mister Tidy can be more readily befuddled by obstacles, especially with regard to fencing and walls that surround a settlement -- they will hinder its ability to enter and exit that place.   So an \"open\" settlement environment is generally best.\n<br />\n<br />If this mod's initial quest is not starting for you after being installed with the Vortex mod manager, it might be because it has not been properly activated/enabled.  If you click PLUGINS within Vortex, you will then see which mods are truly activated/enabled or not (whereas the MODS section sometimes shows incorrect information). Within that PLUGINS interface you can activate/enable the mods that were not properly set when installed.\n<br />\n<br />Corpses for NPCs created by the NPCs Travel mod are intentionally not removed because it breaks that mod by preventing those NPCs from re-spawning as intended.  So depending on the frequency/quantity/importance of NPCs Travel's enemies for a player's settlement fights, this mod might not be very useful.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=lightgreen]Known Conflicts:[/color][/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />There is a conflict between this mod and War Of The Commonwealth which can result in crashes.  I have identified the specific conflict, but at present there is no fix or workaround that I can provide.  So it is best to not use the two mods at the same time.\n<br />\n<br />[s]Corpses for NPCs created by the NPCs Travel mod will no longer re-spawn as originally intended if those corpses are tidied-away by Mr Tidy.[/s]  Fixed by NPCs Travel v2.95.\n<br />\n<br />The initial quest can be prevented from starting, or become stalled part-way through, when using a buggy \"quick start\" or \"alternate start\" mod.  The quest normally begins a short while after exiting from Vault 111 for the first time, or a short while after loading a saved game when already outdoors in the Commonwealth.  Otherwise, it might (or might not) begin when standing for a few minutes outdoors at the Sanctuary Hills workbench.\n<br />\n<br />If you experience crashes while traveling during the initial quest, or are unable to complete that quest, it is then highly likely some other mod has been installed that \"breaks\" the Vault 111 area (or possibly the Sanctuary settlement) thereby preventing this mod from working correctly.\n<br />\n<br />If you are not able to find the \"Structures&gt;Miscellaneous\" subcategory, then you installed a mod that alters the basic construction categories of the game. In which case you may not be able to build the Station Pad, and hence will not be able to use this mod -- if you are lucky, the conflicting mod may have simply rearranged items, with the Station Pad now residing elsewhere in some other category or subcategory instead of where it was intended to be. \n<br />\n<br />[s]Please be aware that \"Anom's Sanctuary Hills Overhaul\" has been reported to conflict with some of my Settlement mods, such that when both are installed the player is then no longer able to create a new saved game.  This might (or might not) be the case here as well.[/s]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=lightgreen]To Uninstall:[/color][/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />Uninstall with the mod manager that was used for the original install, or delete SettlementTidyBot files.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=lightgreen]Permissions:[/color][/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />This mod may not be reused in part or whole for any purpose other than its original intent.  It may not be uploaded to any other web site.\n<br />\n<br />Get in touch with me if you wish to discuss translation into a non-English language; prior approval is mandatory.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=lightgreen]Change Log:[/color][/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />See the Change Log to review what is included in each update.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=lightgreen]Credits:[/color][/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />Bethesda Softworks - for the original Models and Textures  [I merely provided the ingenuity and scripting to bring Mister Tidy \"to life\"]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=lightgreen]My Other Mods:[/color][/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />Shield Bubble can be found [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/30669][u][color=lightblue]Here[/color][/u][/url].\n<br />\n<br />Qwirky can be found [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/29576][u][color=lightblue]Here[/color][/u][/url].\n<br />\n<br />Sparky can be found [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/28051][u][color=lightblue]Here[/color][/u][/url].\n<br />\n<br />Silver Streak can be found [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/24911][u][color=lightblue]Here[/color][/u][/url].\n<br />\n<br />Silver Streak UFO can be found [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/24911][u][color=lightblue]Here[/color][/u][/url].\n<br />\n<br />Whirly can be found [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/13449][u][color=lightblue]Here[/color][/u][/url].\n<br />\n<br />Whirligig Sentry can be found [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/23331][u][color=lightblue]Here[/color][/u][/url].\n<br />\n<br />Alien Disruptor can be found [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/19037][u][color=lightblue]Here[/color][/u][/url].\n<br />\n<br />Settlement Radar Station &amp; Drone Defenders can be found [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/30665][u][color=lightblue]Here[/color][/u][/url].\n<br />\n<br />Settlement Medic Bot: \"Mister Medic\" can be found [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/37655][u][color=lightblue]Here[/color][/u][/url].\n<br />\n<br />Settlement Police Bot: \"Mister Law\" can be found [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/37730][u][color=lightblue]Here[/color][/u][/url].\n<br />\n<br />Settlement Repair Bot: \"Mister Mechanic\" can be found [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/37933][u][color=lightblue]Here[/color][/u][/url].\n<br />\n<br />Settlement Salvage Bot: \"Mister Salvage\" can be found [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/32212][u][color=lightblue]Here[/color][/u][/url].\n<br />\n<br />Settlement Gardener Bot: \"Mister Gardener\" can be found [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/38281][u][color=lightblue]Here[/color][/u][/url].\n<br />\n<br />Settlement Delivery Bots: \"Mister Caravan / Mister Express / Mister Postman\" can be found [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/41657][u][color=lightblue]Here[/color][/u][/url].\n<br />\n<br />Carry-Your-Stuff Robots can be found [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/47892][u][color=lightblue]Here[/color][/u][/url].\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=lightgreen]In Memoriam:[/color][/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />In memory of my Father (may he Rest In Peace) who was a model airplane maker (gliders &amp; gas powered) and an RC enthusiast. \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=lightblue]Enjoy![/color][/size][/b]",

Now she'll only ever say that line once, and at the right time. Same with comments about looting, crafting, chem use, etc.\n<br />\n<br />2) Adds new situation-appropriate dialogue for companions. They'll have more to say and seem more aware of their surroundings.\n<br />\n<br />3) New dialogue menu options for Cait, Curie, Piper, Valentine, Hancock, Danse, Deacon, and Gage. They all give side quests now, except Curie, who can serve as a vendor and combat medic once she's converted to a synth.\n<br />\n<br />4) Generic vanilla settler dialogue now pulls from a bank of over 150 lines instead of just 21, multiplied by up to 10 different potential voice types for each line.\n<br />\n<br />5) Settlers are aware of your quest progression, and while they still occasionally complain about \"my back hurts, my feet hurt...\", they display increased awareness of the dangers lurking in the Commonwealth, expressing gratitude for the protection you've provided them, with a more tolerable balance between positive, neutral, negative, and snarky comments. If your settlement happiness is high enough, they will occasionally give you small gifts when expressing their gratitude.\n<br />\n<br />6) Adds additional combat dialogue variety to Raiders and Gunners.\n<br />\n<br />In total, the mod adds over 2,300 voice lines to companions, settlers, and enemies. \n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ff00][b][u]How it works[/u][/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />This was accomplished with vanilla dialogue by:\n<br />\n<br />[color=#9fc5e8][color=#ea9999]- Incorporating content that was cut from the game[/color]\n<br />[color=#b6d7a8]- Editing and splicing existing lines to create new ones[/color]\n<br />- Re-purposing hidden or rare dialogue to apply to new situations\n<br />[color=#b4a7d6]- Flagging certain annoying/repetitive lines to only be said once (e.g. loot junk comments)[/color]\n<br />[color=#ffe599]- Adding cool-down timers to other repetitive lines (e.g. combat taunts)[/color][/color]\n<br />\n<br />No NPC records were edited - only companion dialogue quest records and the 'DialogueFarmGeneric' quest (for settlers). No vanilla scripts were touched. NPC appearance mods are fully compatible, as are mods that affect NPC stats, NPC leveled lists, and companion affinity.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ff00][b][u]Companions[/u][/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Companion dialogue diversity is only as good as the most repeated line. Piper has over two-thousand lines, but you hear only a small fraction of those on a typical play-through. Some of her wittiest lines trigger only if she's with you on a particular quest, while some of her combat lines she says dozens of times.\n<br />\n<br />I've traveled with Piper over 200 hours. Sorting through the raw audio files to make this mod, I was shocked to find hundreds of lines I'd never heard her say before.\n<br />\n<br />A lot of us travel with companions for as long as they're interesting and not annoying. When they start repeating the same lines over and over, we lose interest and dismiss them. With this mod, that happens much later into the game.\n<br />\n<br />The companion dialogue that is added here doesn't change their characters. It's the same companions you're used to, just with more content. Specifically:\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ffff][color=#00ff00]- Triple the amount of general combat lines (detect enemy, taunt enemy, victory line) for Cait, Curie, Piper, Valentine, Hancock, Danse, Deacon, and Gage.[/color]\n<br />\n<br />- Lots of new random idles, especially in dungeons, and sometimes with a sarcastic slant if it suits the character.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffff00]- Certain vanilla random idles that tend to repeat often will now only be said once.[/color]\n<br />[color=#1e84cc]\n<br />- When you loot, pick a lock, hack a terminal, use a workbench, take drugs, eat a corpse, walk around naked, enter power armor, etc., your companion will comment, but they will never repeat that same comment again.[/color][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[center]﻿[youtube]TXVtZTQTRiI[/youtube][/center][color=#00ffff][u][color=#00ff00][b][u]Settlers[/u][/b][/color][/u][/color]\n<br />\n<br />I was trying to figure out why I lost interest in settlement building about 6 months after the game launched. The settlement mods that have released since then are incredible. Why am I not motivated to engage with that part of the game anymore?\n<br />\n<br />Partly because it doesn't feel like my actions matter. Not only does the game not in any way react to the massive colony I've built on Spectacle Island, the settlers there don't care either. They're still complaining about the same old things.\n<br />\n<br />I wanted the game to feel like the settlers were on the same team as me, functioning as more than professional mooches. If I'm General of the Minutemen, call me \"General\" once in a while, and talk to me about tactical stuff. Acknowledge the threats we face and the things we're doing to solve problems. Or barring that, at least be semi-interesting and make me laugh occasionally.\n<br />\n<br />So that's what I tried to implement via more dialogue lines, much of it conditioned upon what's going on in the game and/or the settlement. The increased variety in settler dialogue only occurs if a settlement's happiness is above 60, and some of the lines won't trigger until happiness is closer to 100.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ff00][b][u]Raiders and Gunners[/u][/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Raider and Gunner combat lines have been tweaked to make them sound a little smarter, and to increase variety. This was done by adding lines (over 130) from cut content, DLC, and re-purposing voice files from quests where lines are only said once in specific areas (e.g. Museum of Freedom, Combat Zone, Cabot quest line).\n<br />\n<br />The new lines are general in nature, not location specific, and it's stuff like: \"You're goin' nowhere\", \"C'mon, I got places to be!\", \"Get it over with and die already!\", \"God dammit! You're gonna regret ever comin' here!\", etc. It sounds indistinguishable from the vanilla combat, there's just more of it. \n<br />\n<br />Also, Raiders won't call you \"Rookie\" once you're not a rookie anymore, and several of the lines that make Raiders sound comically obtuse have been flagged as \"say once\": e.g.  \"Hiding? From me? Not even possible...\"\", \"What the...!? No, no, it's nothing..\" Raiders will still sound dumb, saying lines like \"Huh?\", Wha?\", \"What the...\", but it won't be quite as over-the-top as it is in the vanilla game.\n<br />\n<br />When stalking Gunners, they'll no longer say a few of the lines that make them sound incompetent: e.g. \"Huh?\" \"Wha?\", so it feels more like you're encountering trained mercenaries instead of dumb Raiders.\n<br />\n<br />[left][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/41785/41785-1575190586-1130611822.png[/img]﻿[/left][center][/center][color=#00ff00][b][u]Quests[/u][/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Certain companions give repeatable quests now:\n<br />\n<br />- Piper gives you the quests \"[color=#93c47d]Anything for a Story[/color]\" to explore places you haven't cleared yet and \"[color=#93c47d]You Can't Stop the Press[/color]\" to gather supplies for her newspaper business.\n<br />\n<br />- Cait offers a quest \"[color=#93c47d]Lookin' for Trouble[/color]\" to hunt down those Raiders she talks so much about hating.\n<br />\n<br />- Danse assigns you the quest \"[color=#93c47d]Outstanding, Soldier![/color]\" to eliminate Super Mutants and Feral Ghouls.\n<br />\n<br />- Hancock has a quest \"[color=#93c47d]Because I Got High[/color]\" to track down chem stashes.\n<br />\n<br />- Nick gives the quests \"[color=#93c47d]Lost and Found[/color]\" to track down stolen property for Diamond City residents and \"[color=#93c47d]Commonwealth Justice[/color]\" to complete bounties on behalf of the Diamond City Council.\n<br />\n<br />- Gage gives the quest \"[color=#93c47d]Let's Go Kill Some Sh*t[/color]\" to wipe out rival gangs.\n<br />\n<br />- Deacon also gives a non-repeatable quest called [color=#93c47d]\"Coming Clean\"[/color] once you've maxed his affinity. Ask him \"What's News?\" and cycle through all the dialogue to start the quest and experience a new chapter of his never-ending stream of B.S.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ffff][u]Radiant quests are lame[/u][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ea9999]Typical BoS/Institute quest[/color]: Talk to Quest Giver &gt; Travel to Dungeon &gt; Kill bad guys &gt; Travel to Quest Giver &gt; Talk to Quest Giver.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f6b26b]Typical Preston quest[/color]: Talk to Preston &gt; Travel to Settler &gt; Talk to Settler &gt; Travel to Dungeon &gt; Kill bad guys &gt; Travel to Settler &gt; Talk to Settler &gt; Travel to Preston &gt; Talk to Preston. \n<br />\n<br />That's a lot of talking and load screens for not much action. It's more fun when the quest giver travels with you to do the quest: Talk to Companion &gt; Travel to Dungeon &gt; Kill bad guys &gt; Talk to Companion. \n<br />\n<br />These new quests are optional, nothing is forced, and you can cancel the quest by talking to the companion. The side quests are accessed via the 'More Options' dialogue menu. Completing a quest for a companion will raise their affinity (\"like\" or \"love\" event), grant a small amount of XP, and yield caps or a custom reward. \n<br />\n<br />This gives you potentially a new way to explore the Commonwealth and discover most locations naturally without needing to do the main quest.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ffff][u]What else?[/u][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Beyond quests, this mod didn't fit well into an existing category. It's similar in spirit to [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1187]Relationship Dialogue Overhaul [/url]for Skyrim, but \"Overhaul\" typically implies something that edits a lot of things and requires a slew of patches. This has a light footprint- shouldn't require any patches. Doesn't add a new companion, or new NPC's, or conflict with any mods that alter companion/NPC appearance or stats.\n<br />\n<br />[center]﻿[youtube]gMtn-nGmTDg[/youtube][/center]\n<br />[color=#00ff00][b][u]Load Order and Compatibility[/u][/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />There are various mods that add or edit Fallout 4 dialogue. If you run one of those mods, here's where they go in load order relative to this mod (SCDO) so that it all plays nice together and you receive the benefits of both mods. \"Below\" means \"After\", and \"Above\" means \"Before\".\n<br />\n<br />[b][i][color=#f6b26b][u]Below SCDO in load order[/u][/color][/i][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/25050]Deeper Thoughts Curie[/url] - Adds some additional dialogue to Curie. Mostly redundant with SCDO installed, but will add a little extra variety to idle comments.\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/25525]Icebreaker Piper - Companion Dialogue Overhaul[/url] - Adds more dialogue to Piper. Largely redundant with SCDO unless you would like more Piper responses to specific player actions (e.g. loot junk, swim, eat corpse, pick lock, etc), and some additional greetings.\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/13717/?]Nick Valentine Romance [/url]-  Allows you to romance Nick Valentine. Load order shouldn't matter, but put it below SCDO to be safe.\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/10365]No companion junk comments[/url] - Companions never comment on looting junk at all (versus in SCDO they'll say it once). Load order shouldn't matter, but place below SCDO just in case.\n<br />\n<br />[b][i][color=#f6b26b][u]Above SCDO in load order[/u][/color][/i][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/26638]Flirty Commonwealth[/url] - Edits and adds some flirty some companion idle comments. The Raider taunts it adds play really well with this mod (no overlap).\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/14108]Immersive Generic Dialogues [/url]- Edits some settler idle comments and companion idle comments.\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/22166?]\n<br />Player Comments and Head Tracking[/url] - Edits some companion idle lines by adding player responses to them. If you place this, or its patch, below SCDO in load order, the repetition that SCDO removes from certain companion comments (e.g. Loot junk, pick lock, eat corpse, walk around naked) and idle comments (e.g. Cait's \"we'd move faster if you kept your eyes on the road and off me arse\"), will be reintroduced. For best results, do not use the unauthorized SCDO patch available for download on the Player Comments mod page.\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/4598]\n<br />Unofficial Fallout 4 Patch[/url] - Fixes typos on companion idle lines, and these fixes have been incorporated into SCDO, without requiring UF4P to be installed (although you should probably have it installed for a plethora of other reasons).\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/25972/?]\n<br />Icebreaker Settlements - Settler Dialogue Overhaul [/url]- Adds more dialogue to settlers via the 'DialogueFarmGeneric' quest. Largely redundant with SCDO. Load order shouldn't matter, but as SCDO has more variety in settler dialogue, place SCDO lower in load order to be safe.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#f6b26b][i][u]In General[/u][/i][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />As a starting point, put SCDO below your quest mods. \n<br />\n<br />Except as noted above, place SCDO [color=#00ffff]below[/color] anything else editing the [color=#ffe599]companion dialogue quests[/color]. (ComPiperTalk, ComCaitTalk, etc). If you screw up, not a big deal, the result is that you may not see 100% of the features from this mod for a particular companion if another mod is overwriting the same dialogue topic.\n<br />\n<br />You can check whether a mod edits a quest by loading all your mods in FO4Edit, clicking on the Quest records in this mod, and seeing whether any other mods edit the same Dialogue Topic within a quest (i.e. look for red and orange records when both mods are loaded in FO4Edit).\n<br />\n<br />Other than that, SCDO should be [color=#00ffff]compatible with everything unless explicitly stated otherwise.  [/color]\n<br />\n<br />Compatible with mods that edit NPC appearances, mods that edit leveled lists, mods that affect companion affinity or companion stats, multi-follower mods, Horizon, Sim Settlements/Conqueror, Start Me Up, Better Settlers, No Negative Affinity, Visible Companion Affinity, Full Dialogue Interface, Extended Dialogue Interface, Realistic Conversations, Amazing Follower Tweaks, Unlimited Companion Framework, Combat Zone Restored, Keep Both X6-88 and Porter Gage Plus Deacon, Danse Dialogue Overhaul, and the other 30,000 or so mods for Fallout 4, unless stated otherwise on the mod page.\n<br />\n<br />[center][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/41785/41785-1573848586-1768463613.png[/img]﻿﻿[/center][color=#00ff00][b][u]Requirements and Installation[/u][/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />The base game, Automatron, Nuka World, and Vault-Tec Workshop are required. No other mods are required.\n<br />\n<br />Install like any regular mod. You can use the mod at any point on an existing save game. It also works on a new save game.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ff00][b][u]Translations[/u][/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Check the Translation drop down menu at the top of the mod page for an updated list of available translations.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ff00][b][u]Troubleshooting[/u][/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />- If a companion's buy/sell vendor menu comes up empty the first time, exit the conversation and try again. If Gage isn't selling chems, dismiss him and re-recruit. \n<br />\n<br />- If Gage turns hostile in \"Open Season\", use the \"Make Gage a Companion Again\" holotape on the counter in Fizztop Grille to restore him, or craft the holotape at a chem station under \"Utility\". If you never want Gage to become hostile in the first place during \"Open Season\", use the mod [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/29192?]Keep Both X6-88 and Porter Gage Plus Deacon[/url].\n<br />\n<br />- If a companion gives a quest, but no quest comes up, it's possible you've cleared all the eligible quest locations and may need to wait for them to respawn. Try asking again, and if that doesn't work, fast travel somewhere else, wait a day or so, then ask again.\n<br />[color=#00ff00][b][u]\n<br />XBox, PlayStation?[/u][/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />PS4: not possible due to voice files. \n<br />XBox: Yes, [url=https://bethesda.net/en/mods/fallout4/mod-detail/4133638]here[/url].\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ff00][b][u]Additional dialogue for other companions?[/u][/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Cait, Curie, Piper, Valentine, and Danse were initially chosen for additional dialogue and new content based on a Discord poll asking the question, \"[color=#ffd966]Which companions do you still play with for 6 hours or more on a Fallout 4 play-through? (Check all that apply)[/color]\". There were over 100 responses, and those were the five companions people still actually use long enough for dialogue repetition to matter. And Dogmeat, but he doesn't talk. Hancock was also given additional dialogue because I like Hancock. Same with Gage, Deacon, and MacCready.\n<br />\n<br />As it stands now:\n<br />\n<br />- Companions with additional dialogue and new content: Cait, Curie, Piper, Valentine, Danse, Deacon, Hancock, Gage, and MacCready\n<br />- Companions adjusted to avoid/reduce repetitive dialogue: All of the above plus Ada, Preston, Codsworth, X6-88, and Strong.\n<br />- Companions for whom no adjustments were made: Dogmeat and Old Longfellow\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ff00][b][u]More Quest Content?[/u][/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />This mod plays nice with the following quest mods if you want another 60+ hours of Fallout 4 content:\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/35513]Depravity[/url] - (August 2019 Mod of the Month)\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/28085]Project Valkyrie[/url] - (August 2018 Mod of the Month)\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/21469]Outcasts &amp; Remnants [/url]﻿- (April 2017 Mod of the Month Runner Up)\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/16423]Fusion City Rising[/url] - (September 2016 Mod of the Month)\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/45546]Diary of a Madman[/url] - (Alternate path to Depravity's evil ending to the vanilla game)\n<br />\n<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/xrT20hp.png[/img]﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿[/center]The quest locations in this mod have very little overlap with the locations in the mods above.

            "description": "[u][size=6][b]Overview[/b][/size][/u]\n<br />\n<br />A simple mod that makes it unsafe to rest in uninhabited areas at night. Your sleep can be interrupted by an enemy ambush or any number of wasteland creatures. \n<br />\n<br />[center]\n<br />[youtube]MX2pBOFXxzU[/youtube][/center]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][u]Requirements[/u][/size]\n<br />\n<br />Sleepless Nights was compiled with Fallout 4 patch 1.10.114. It may or may not work with older versions of Fallout 4.\n<br />\n<br />[u][size=6][b]Details[/b][/size][/u]\n<br />\n<br />[b]A) How Often will I get attacked?[/b]\n<br />\n<br />In normal mode, you are safe to sleep in the daytime. The probability of being attacked at night is determined by how long you sleep and your luck:\n<br /> \n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]1 hour   : 10% chance of being attacked\n<br />[*]2 hours : 13%  chance of being attacked\n<br />[*]4 hours : 20%  chance of being attacked\n<br />[*]8 hours : 50%  chance of being attacked\n<br />[/list]\n<br />    Luck:\n<br />  [list]\n<br />[*]Poor Luck  (0 -&gt; 3) multiplies odds of getting attacked by 1.25\n<br />[*]Good Luck  (7 -&gt; 9) multiplies odds of getting attacked by 0.75\n<br />[*]Great Luck (10+)    multiplies odds of getting attacked by 0.50    \n<br />[/list]\n<br />Example:\n<br />\n<br />If you sleep for 7 hours, normally there is a 20% chance of being attacked. If your luck score is 3 or less, that increases to a 25% chance. If your luck is 10 or more, odds drop to a 10% chance. \n<br />\n<br />[b]B)  Enemies[/b]\n<br />\n<br />The number of enemies in a wave is determined by your level. After level 35,  there is a 50% chance you will get a second random wave of enemies if the first roll succeeds. IE: You might get a group of deathclaws and a group of raiders all at once. \n<br />\n<br />[b]C)  Safe Locations[/b]\n<br />\n<br />You are always 100% safe to sleep in big cities such as Diamond City, Goodneighbor, Bunker Hill, Vault 81, Far harbor, Arcadia, Nuka Town and Most Vaults. You are also generally safe to sleep in your Faction Stronghold.\n<br />\n<br />In normal mode, you are also safe to sleep in the daytime and in owned settlements. However settlements are only safe at night if their defense rating is 20 or higher. Night is considered the hours between 9:30 PM and 5:30 AM.\n<br />\n<br />In Nightmare mode, you can be attacked even in owned settlements. However, settlers may help defend the player.\n<br />\n<br />Finally, if you are attacked on a given day, you will not be attacked the next time you sleep unless you enable the option to allow multiple attacks per day. \n<br />\n<br />[size=4][u][b]Nightmare Mode[/b][/u][/size]\n<br />\n<br />Users can optionally enable Nightmare mode. In nightmare mode:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]You can be attacked anytime you sleep, day or night\n<br />[*]Basic settlements no longer offer protection. \n<br />[*]Only big cities and indoor strongholds are safe.\n<br />[*]Every 7th day, sleeping carries a 50% risk of being attacked by a Ghoul Horde\n<br />[/list]  \n<br />Ghoul Horde:\n<br />  \n<br />A ghoul horde is a sizable group of ghouls that arrive in 3 waves. Each wave is tougher than the previous. Hi-level glowing ghouls can emit a radiation burst that heals and resurrects nearby dead ghouls from earlier waves. This is what makes Ghoul Hordes particularly dangerous. One stray final boss can resurrect all 3 previous waves at once. \n<br />  \n<br />So keep an eye on your Game Day. If it is divisible by 7, find shelter or be prepared for a major battle.\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][u][b]Daydream Mode[/b][/u][/size]\n<br />\n<br />An optional mode for users who want sleepless nights to be less challenging so they don't have to reload their save games as much.   In this mode:\n<br />      [list]\n<br />[*]You can sleep up to 2 hours with 0% chance of being interrupted\n<br />[*]Sleeping for 3 or 4 hours is less risky\n<br />[*]The Max Number of Sleeps before a mandatory attack is doubled\n<br />\n<br />[*]Sleeping within the boundaries of any settlement is safe. Ownership and defense rating don't matter.\n<br />\n<br />[*]Enemies still level with the player, but the number of enemies stops increasing at level 20. \n<br />[*]No larger-than-man sized enemies. IE: No Behemoths or Deathclaws\n<br />[*]No possibility of a second wave of enemies or Ghoul Horde.\n<br />\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[i][u]Shameless Self Promotion[/u]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2]This mod was created to complement the mod [/size][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/26976]Amazing Follower Tweaks[/url][/i][size=2][i] in order to increase the value of multiple companions and a portable camp with defensive capabilities. While recommended, AFT is not needed for this mod to work.\n<br />[/i][/size]\n<br />[size=6]Usage:[/size]\n<br />[size=2]\n<br />After being installed, you will find a Misc Holotape in your inventory called \"Sleepless Nights Settings\"\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[list=1]\n<br />[*][ ] Nightmare Mode - Toggle this option on if you wish to play in nightmare mode.\n<br />[*][ ] Daydream Mode - Toggle to play in Daydream Mode\n<br />[*][ ] Allow Multiple attacks per day -  Toggle if you don't mind being attacked multiple times a day.\n<br />[*]Force Attack After [ ] Sleeps - determines max sleeps in uninhabited areas before an attack is forced.\n<br />[*]Prepare for Uninstall - Select to shut down Sleepless Nights Scripts. Recommended before disabling the mod. \n<br />[*]Tab to Exit - Reminder, but also offers a back door to the Debug Menu. Click 6 times and it changes to [Debug Menu].\n<br />[/list][center]﻿[/center]",

It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. [/size]\n<br />[size=3]And (if provoked) it absolutely will not stop, EVER, until you are dead. [/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]Now only very capable adventurers (or other robots) should mess with a combat robot, or synth. [/size]\n<br />[size=3]Which means having power armor would definitely be useful. I strongly recommend [/size][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/2249/?]WIPAG[/url][size=3] mod for some proper Power Armor gearing. [/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]A sentry bot should now be pretty much the toughest (non-Boss) opponent you can face in the wasteland. Well, it's a monstrous nuclear powered ([b][size=3]judging from the explosion)[/size][/b] electro-mechanical [/size][color=#cc0000][size=4]DEATH machine![/size][/color][size=3] It deserves all the bonuses. [/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][img]http://i64.tinypic.com/20pbuc5.jpg[/img][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]In case you didn't realize from the intro, this mod makes all robots SUPAPOWERFUL, but not ridiculously so. I believe they are now as strong as a (Fallout) robot should be. [/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]Specifically all roboids get the following benefits: [/size]\n<br />[/b][list]\n<br />[*][b][size=3]x4 health [/size][/b]\n<br />[*][b][size=3]x2 damage resistance [/size][/b]\n<br />[*][b][size=3]x2 energy resistance [/size][/b]\n<br />[*][b][size=3]75+ unarmed damage (where applicable)[/size][/b]\n<br />[/list][b][size=3]Sole exception to the damage and energy resistance bonuses is the robobrain race. \n<br />That's because they are too \"exposed\", as one can easily shoot their \"brains\" [i]clean off[/i]. \n<br />\n<br />The Sentry race of Robots gets the following benefits instead: \n<br />[/size][/b][list]\n<br />[*][b][size=3]x8 health [/size][/b]\n<br />[*][b][size=3]x4 damage resistance [/size][/b]\n<br />[*][b][size=3]x2 energy resistance [/size][/b]\n<br />[*][b][size=3]Double damage output to all its ranged damage dealers (from its miniguns to rockets etc) [/size][/b]\n<br />[*][b][size=3]x4 unarmed damage[/size][/b]\n<br />[*][b][size=3]x1.25 scaling of model dimensions[/size][/b]\n<br />[/list][b][size=3]\n<br />All synths get the following benefits: \n<br />[/size][/b][list]\n<br />[*][b][size=3]x2 health[/size][/b]\n<br />[*][b][size=3]x2 damage resistance[/size][/b]\n<br />[*][b][size=3]75+ unarmed damage (where applicable)[/size][/b]\n<br />[/list][b][size=3]Coursers get all the synth's benefits and in addition:\n<br />[/size][/b][list]\n<br />[*][b][size=3]x2 energy resistance[/size][/b]\n<br />[/list][b][size=3]\n<br />All turrets (which are completely ridiculous in vanilla) get the following benefits: \n<br />[/size][/b][list]\n<br />[*][b][size=3]x10 health[/size][/b]\n<br />[*][b][size=3]x2 damage resistance[/size][/b]\n<br />[*][b][size=3]x2 energy resistance[/size][/b]\n<br />[*][b][size=3]x3 base damage output[/size][/b]\n<br />[*][b][size=3]x1.4 increased range [/size][/b]\n<br />[/list][size=3][b]Turrets were positioned there to cover the area for a long time.

An abandoned tunnel was added to connect Glowsea to West Roxbury Station.\n<br />\n<br />This mod connects 90% of the standard subway stations, and creates a network of subway tunnels filled with raiders, super mutants, synths and ghouls. Subway stations have been added throughout this network. With a focus on survival play through there are easy to access to beds for save points to bunk down for the night. This system once cleared out of enemies allows the player to move quickly across the wasteland. Be warned the battles to take back the network and make them safe for travel will be not an easy one. \n<br />\n<br />The maps are fully nav meshed and companion friendly. \n<br />I recommend using companion whistle to keep them close, especially if you are using more the one companion. \n<br />\n<br />This mod is large and modifies some world spaces to allow access to the subway network. I to care to avoid settlement locations and areas that could conflict with other mods.\n<br />\n<br />To gain access to Good Neighbor you must complete the quest “The Big Dig” otherwise the station is inaccessible from the surface.  I did this as 3rd rail is often used by other modders as a player home. \n<br />\n<br />[b][u]Not compatible with underhouse mod.\n<br />\n<br />[/u][/b]There are some issues with other immersive mods, notably stumble upon, interior and bean town. \n<br />\n<br />You will have to play with load order to get them all to work together. \n<br />\n<br />Currently I have interior over hall, then subway runner, bean town and stumble upon, I am still playing through a play through with this order but it appears to work.\n<br />\n<br />There is no plans to incorporate dlc. I purchased the season pass for ps4 when we were promised mods, have no intention of paying another $70 for dlc I already own. \n<br />\n<br />My to-do list for future updates, I will check them off as I go and upload hopefully 1 big update.\n<br />\n<br />Move light sources away from the walls,\n<br />\n<br />Remove 2-3 loot tables from each cell as they are noticeably over represent.\n<br />\n<br />Try to figure out why the grenade arks are not present\n<br />\n<br />Add more rubble to prevent pop up and noticeable draw distance. \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][center][u][size=6]Links to GHOST FC3S's other projects\n<br />[/size][b]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/38314][size=3]Survival First Aid[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/38314][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/thumbnails/38314/38314-1554304183-1006702144.jpeg[/img][/url][/b][/u]\n<br />\n<br />[b][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/36006][size=3]Ammo boxes to mags[/size][/url]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/36006][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/thumbnails/36006/36006-1542686556-569258488.jpeg[/img]\n<br />[/url][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/35712]RU556 Armoury Project\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/thumbnails/35712/35712-1541624148-1458128811.jpeg[/img]﻿\n<br />\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/33088]No main quest - Wasteland Operator mod[/url]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/33088][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/thumbnails/33088/33088-1531035112-736160208.jpeg[/img]\n<br />[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/30927]Galac-Tac\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/thumbnails/30927/30927-1522788284-769146834.jpeg[/img]﻿\n<br />\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/27244]Minuteman's Last Stand\n<br />[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/27244][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/thumbnails/27244-0-1507655660.jpg[/img][/url]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/18639]Subway Runner[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/18639]\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/thumbnails/18639-2-1474432422.jpg[/img]\n<br />\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/16476]Kerberos Panzer Cop Jin Roh The wolf\n<br />\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/16476][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/thumbnails/16476-4-1469059341.jpg[/img][/url]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/31605]FROST Craftable Liquor with VALDACIL tag[/url]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/31605][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/thumbnails/31605/31605-1525698743-1898567590.jpeg[/img]\n<br />[/url]\n<br />[/center][/b]",

If you don&#39;t, then the mod was not installed correctly. See [url=http://wiki.tesnexus.com/index.php/Fallout_4_Mod_Installation]here[/url] for instructions on how to set up Fallout 4 for modding.\r<br />\r<br />You will receive Take Cover and Take Cover Config in the AID section of your inventory.\r<br />\r<br />At this point, the cover system is active. Sprint towards a wall with your weapon drawn to take cover.\r<br />\r<br />You can also hotkey the Take Cover activator to a quick-key in your favorites to quickly enter and exit cover at any point in time, or use [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/11664/]FO4 Hotkeys[/url] to bind it to any key on your keyboard or any extra mouse buttons you may have. I highly recommend binding Take Cover to Shift+Aim with FO4Hotkeys so that you have cover available at the touch of your mouse.\r<br />\r<br />Use Take Cover Config to configure various aspects of the cover system, including whether sprint-to-cover is turned on and whether cover-vaulting is enabled.[/font]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#f6b26b][font=Courier New][size=5][b]★ Notes ★[/b][/size][/font][/color]\r<br />[font=Lucida Sans Unicode]\r<br />[size=4]☢ [/size]It wasn&#39;t easy to do, but yes - it works great with VATS&#33; VATS traditionally roots you to the spot and gives you no movement control, but this mod lets you &#34;pop-out&#34; of cover even in VATS.

It&#39;s off by default. If turned on, you will automatically enter third-person and go into cover when sprinting up against a wall in first-person. From 1.1 onwards, you&#39;ll also automatically return to first-person when leaving cover if you entered from it.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />Q: Sprint-to-cover is not sensitive enough / too sensitive&#33; (entering cover when you don&#39;t actually want to)\r<br />\r<br />A: [color=#cccccc]Every system is different, and you might want to tweak the sensitivity of cover-entering yourself&#33; I&#39;ve provided a couple of preset options in the Config - you have Default, High, and Very High to specify how still you have to be while sprinting before you enter cover.\r<br />\r<br />You can tweak these values beyond the presets that I&#39;ve given with this console command:\r<br />[font=Courier New]cqf cover setsensitivity &lt;your desired value here&gt;[/font]\r<br />\r<br />The preset values in the Config are:\r<br />Default: 2\r<br />High: 10\r<br />Very High: 20\r<br />\r<br />To make entering cover less sensitive, you can type [font=Courier New]cqf cover setsensitivity 0.5[/font] to lower the sensitivity below the default.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />Q: Blind-firing?\r<br />\r<br />A: [color=#cccccc]Yes&#33; You can blind-fire around cover by just hitting the fire button without aiming down sights.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />Q: How do I see if the mod is working for me?\r<br />\r<br />A: [color=#cccccc]Compare your cover experience with those in the linked video showcases&#33; That&#39;s what you can expect from Take Cover.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />Q: I want to uninstall Take Cover.\r<br />\r<br />A: [color=#cccccc]Run the console command [font=Courier New]cqf cover uninstall[/font].

This allows you to keep the core in while staying nearby to do your charisma checks or whatever, and hopping back in without having to reinsert. Or if you are Eric and apparently constantly just accidentally jump out of your armor on accident. Honestly depending on feedback distance mode will probably become the default in future versions.\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]HI0gox4KNZA[/youtube][/quote][b][color=#e06666][size=6][u]\r<br />Settings[/u][/size][/color][/b]\r<br />\r<br />Because we have no MCM all settings are done through changing variables from the console.

            "description": "[img]https://i.imgur.com/7H62tPs.png[/img]\n<br />This is attempt to replace VATS system with bullet time. Based on great [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/15875]VAFS - VaultTec Accelerated Focus System[/url] [i]by Ashnal[/i]. Since I wanted use MCM hotkeys, I decided to completely rebuild the mod from scratch, adding some new ideas. [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/21497]Mod Configuration Menu[/url]﻿ is now required, as well as [url=http://f4se.silverlock.org/]F4SE[/url]﻿.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#b6d7a8]What is new[/color][/b]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]MCM support for configuration and hotkeys (to use Q change VATS hotkey in game menu first)\n<br />[*]Settings stored in ﻿[code]MCM&#92;Settings&#92;VAFS Redux.ini[/code]\n<br />[*]Fixed or replaced mechanics that didn't work\n<br />[*]Support for Perks excluded in original mod\n<br />[*]Restored chems, now one slow time won't activate while other is active\n<br />[*]Slow time from perk [i]Nerd Rage![/i] and [i]Marty's legendary armor mod[/i] dispel VAFS\n<br />[*]Weapon AP cost taken directly from equipped weapon - supports new weapons\n<br />[*]New animation for using Critical and Four Leaf Clover (like in VATS)\n<br />[*]Disabled VATS, can be activated in MCM, but mod aims to replace it\n<br />[*]VATS ability are usable outside of VATS (Awareness, VANS)\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[b][color=#b6d7a8]MCM Hotkeys[/color][/b]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]hotkeys to activate Focus and Critical are accepted only without modifier (no Shift, Ctrl, Alt)\n<br />\n<br />[*]if key is already in use by game (like Q for VATS), you need to change it in game settings or it won't work in MCM\n<br />[*]Awareness and Vans abilities are used holding hotkeys for Focus and Critical\n<br />[*]Awareness and Vans can use separated hotkey if set in MCM and will accept modifier (e.g. Shift+Q)\n<br />[*]MCM won't accept gamepad button as hotkey, you will need to use consumables or third party program to simulate keyboard press with gamepad\n<br />\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/S84ujFg.png[/img]\n<br />Focus replaces VATS with bullet time, that scales mainly with Perception. For most parts, vanilla VATS [i]accuracy[/i] is replaced with [i]slow factor[/i] (how strong will slow time be). In comparison to original mod, slow factor is lower, especialy with low Perception (can be boosted in MCM), so it's less usefull without investment, just like VATS, and to keep similar [i]\"slow time\"[/i] effect still viable. You can use addictive Jet with strong slow time or use VAFS Focus, that is limited by AP, with weaker slow time and damage penalty. Don't worry though, if you build your character around VAFS, slow time will be even stronger than Jet, and damage penalty can be adjusted or completely turned off in MCM.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#b6d7a8]Features[/color][/b]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Slow time scales with Perception, Perks, Equipments\n<br />[*]Activate/deactivate with MCM hotkey\n<br />[*]Various MCM options for AP cost, visual and sound\n<br />[*]While active drains AP/s (def. 30) and for every weapon attack\n<br />[*]Weapons uses their actual AP cost x Mult (def. 0.75 for similar values as original)\n<br />[*]While active +20% accuracy with non-auto weapons but -20% damage (configurable)\n<br />[*]Focus will deactivate when AP runs out, switching weapon or ﻿scripted slow time activates\n<br />[*]Depleting all AP with attacks stop AP regen for 2 sec\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[b][color=#b6d7a8]Perception and Slow Time[/color][/b][list]\n<br />[*]1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9/10 PER =&gt; 20/28/35/41/46/50/53/56/58/60% slow\n<br />[*]With *[i]Stronger Focus[/i] option -&gt; 40/46/52/56/60/63/65/67/69/70% slow\n<br />[*]Each PER past 10 =&gt; +1% up to max 80% at 30 PER (*up to 85%)\n<br />[*]Slow factors are multiplicative not additive\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/NK5iaup.png[/img]\n<br />Successful hit builds up Critical Meter, that can be used anytime.

VAFS uses its own perks, checks if character has their vanilla counterparts and applies new effects. Some effects of original mod was modified or completely changed.

With few exeptions, all entries and scripts are new and separated from vanilla game. Most incompatibilities comes from changed names and description. For example, Perk changing mod will work if loaded after this mod. You will loose VAFS description but both mod will work.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#b6d7a8]Vanilla Edits\n<br />[/color][/b][list]\n<br />[*]Description for Perks, Items, Stats and Loading Screen (they still keep their VATS effects)\n<br />[*]Ricochet (rank 3) chance for VATS is controled by VAFS\n<br />[*]Scripts: [i]LegendaryMagicEffectSlowTimeScript.psc [/i]and [i]PerkNerdRageSlowTimeScript.psc [/i]([url=https://i.imgur.com/3xE8dvD.jpg]code[/url])\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/sbRCxDZ.png[/img]﻿\n<br />There are 3rd person animation related issues that I won't be able to fix:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]character can't melee attack in 3rd person with Blitz perk while moving - game issue tied to move speed animation\n<br />[*]firing auto weapons in 3rd person in VAFS drain AP ~3 times - again issue with 3rd person animation\n<br />[/list]\n<br />In more details, anything that increase character move speed past certain point will couse unability to attack while moving in 3rd person. Most likely it is related to game animation that change from runing to sprinting and thus prevent character to attack, becouse there is no animation for attack while sprinting (don't have much experience in that so its all deduction from testing). For multiple cost while using automatic weapon in 3rd mode there also seems to be a little different animation in 3rd person that looks like gun is fired multiple times and after testing I am inclining to be issue of animation as well. If anyone know better about these issues I will be glad to corrected, until then I recomend to play in 1st person specificaly for those two situation.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/jO2Gmoz.png[/img]﻿\n<br />Big thanks to people, whose work made this mod possible.\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/15875]VAFS - VaultTec Accelerated Focus System - Manual Criticals and Bullet Time[/url]﻿ [i]by Ashnal[/i]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/21497]Mod Configuration Menu[/url]﻿ [i]by reg2k - Neanka - shadowslasher410[/i]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/20309]HUDFramework[/url]﻿ [i]by Registrator2000\n<br />[/i][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/6821]FOMOD Creation Tool[/url]﻿ [i]by Wenderer[/i]",

I am [u]not the developer[/u] of[url=http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/3625875-vault-girl-mod-development-thread/] this mod[/url], but I decided to make my own FOMOD installer. Previously, I did not want to install the textures and some perks from the original Fomod. Also, I got game problems due to old \"forced to install\" files, and I was not the only one. The reason I uploaded it here is to share it with you guys as well as to make possible to manage it with Vortex as a small bonus. I believe the mod will become more popular (since it has never been published on NexusMods), and the people that are able to finish it will probably appear here =) Hopefully, you find my work useful.\n<br />\n<br />This mod aims to replace parts of Vault Boy UI (for the most part) and vanilla Vault Girl UI with a new Vault Girl UI. There are three Vault Girl types: A, B, and C. Currently, it is still Alpha version, and the mod is ON HOLD and not finished yet (LEVEL UP perks, Pip-boy-STAT-PERKS, and Pip-boy-DATA-QUESTS). However, I find it quite good even without those unfinished animations. There are also optional Sign and Poster textures so check them out if you are interested.\n<br />\n<br />Share your images, enjoy, and cya!\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/28822]Mod Developer Recommends - LevelUpMenuEx[/url]﻿[/size][size=3][url=http://imgur.com/a/n0qUN]\n<br />[/url][url=https://imgur.com/a/n0qUN]Mod Image and Gif Gallery﻿ on imgur.com[/url][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[u]Mod overview by Ikari (time 1:32):[/u]\n<br />[youtube]lrxPYjygFyY[/youtube]\n<br />\n<br />Below, are [u]links to the Vault Girl files ported to Xbox[/u] by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/users/981385]chucksteel[/url]﻿ on the basis of my Fomod.

Therefore, I decided to fix the problems and also add several new options.\n<br />What is done:\n<br />[spoiler]0) The beautiful Vault Girl Mod is finally on NexusMods, and you can mange its files by using Vortex! No more manual installation and bug fixes.\n<br />1) Now, Sign and Poster textures are downloaded separately and previously built-in DEF_UI installation files are removed, what makes the mod size much much smaller (900Mb--&gt;30Mb) and fixes the problem when the \"None\" option for the textures in the original mod did not work correctly.\n<br />2) Vault Girl options are systemized and more flexible making it possible to select \"None\" and install/not install several previously hidden perks.\n<br />3) Added the compatibility patch for the Extended Dialogue Interface. Files copied from [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/35278]here[/url].\n<br />4) Added LEVEL UP colored animations of Vault Girl A, which are copied from [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/14252]here[/url].\n<br />5) Removed excessive files from the archive so that the installation becomes faster and the mod should not cause game crashes or corruption of other mods.[/spoiler]\n<br />I used the [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/6821]FOMOD Creation Tool[/url] and [url=https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v7.6.4.html]Notepad++[/url] to create the installer. [u]If anything works wrong or is missing, please inform me via the Bugs section.[/u]\n<br />\n<br />[u][color=#00ff00][size=4]Development:[/size][/color][/u]\n<br />Unfortunately, I am not good in modding and drawing. However, if you guys can create any patches, I will be glad to upload them here or give you an access to edit this NexusMods page. If you have any files to add, I am able to update the FOMOD installer with them. Some useful for developers files are [url=https://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/3625875-vault-girl-mod-development-thread/]here[/url] (original mod files and guidances) and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/14252?tab=files]here[/url]﻿ (Miscellaneous files).

Not challenging enough? Are you too OP from your high level and the enemies are boring? Sick of walking all over commonwealth with an empty shell of a wasteland? Wish there were more things to kill? - Then this mod is for you![/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#ffd966][size=3]Description[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]This mod is a deep revision of my original spawn mod, called [/size][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/9845][size=3]Commonwealth Spawns Extended[/size][/url][size=3], it contains many changes and improvements over my old project. As mod’s name implies, the main purpose of this mod is to bring more life to the Commonwealth wastes by adding new spawn points for enemy NPCs, animals, and creatures. The addition of thousands of new spawned enemies makes the commonwealth much more chaotic and dangerous, while bringing in entirely new possibilities, including tactical game play and more difficult supplies management. Depending on the spawn setting, the mod can offer a completely new game experience, from a slightly enhanced vanilla spawn system to the extreme hardcore.  This mod brings back enjoyment for game combat and mechanics, from lonesome wanderer in a desolate world, to the new dynamic and chaotic wasteland, where your in game choices, character build and tactical choices will matter more than in the vanilla game. This really makes you believe that the Commonwealth had those 200+ years for the mutants to reproduce and the humans to build a base of their presence in the area.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffd966]Reviews by Jr Mods (4:10 at timeline) and It'sAGundam (5:10) [/color]\n<br />[youtube]r5DjjsIv_Vc[/youtube][youtube]MLVGKUp5OD4[/youtube]\n<br />[size=3][center][color=#ffd966]Review by TheAdipose [/color][/center]\n<br />[center][youtube]SH5W-2wbO-I[/youtube][/center]\n<br />[center][color=#ffd966]General gameplay on high spawn settings by me and Glowing Sea high spawns in video by Wrath3094 (5:05 in timeline).[/color][/center]\n<br />[center][youtube]Jko4XgnbU-A[/youtube][youtube]yJ4xCMxxiPI[/youtube][/center]\n<br />[center][color=#ffd966]Gameplay on low spawns by SyntheticKill, and medium setting gameplay by Corey Hooe.[/color][/center]\n<br />[center][youtube]8g09Zor5vys[/youtube][youtube]DnF2tay1NiL[/youtube][/center][/size]\n<br />[line]\n<br />[b][color=#ffd966][size=3]FEATURES[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=#ff7700]*[/color] A complete spawn overhaul for Commonwealth exteriors, with addition of thousands of spawn points for enemy groups in outskirts of Boston as well as in city itself.[/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=#ff7700]*[/color] Large variety of spawn settings, including spawn point area density, numbers of units in spawned groups, group patrolling, chances of spawning story factions in certain areas, randomness of unit count in spawned groups and respawn settings for new enemy groups.[/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=#ff7700]*[/color] Mod uses random number generator (RNG) based scripts to switch between different group placement points and group enemy numbers. This mechanism offers fully dynamic spawning, with high degree of randomness, meaning you will almost never meet same enemy groups at the same place.[/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=#ff7700]*[/color] All placed spawns are not static anymore and will go on the patrols in the surrounding areas. This new additions brings up completely new experience since you will never know, when and where you will meet the enemy. Your in-game situation can escalate in very unexpected and dramatic fashion, forcing you to react and do tactical decisions on the fly. [/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=#ff7700]*[/color] Faction of the spawned groups will be different depending on area you are in. Many locations in the game will have individual faction lists for new spawns, modelling major faction area of influence. This mechanic offers you a great diversity of encountered enemies, allowing you to encounter any faction from the game. [/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=#ff7700]*[/color] Special group compositions for any generated NPC groups. Each group will have leaders, strong, medium and weak mobs in it. Larger groups will have much greater chance to have some strong units and legendary leaders. Some hard faction unit variations, including power-armored mobs will be common sight in the whole CW area.[/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=#ff7700]*[/color] New spawns will include many factions underused by the vanilla game. Commonly you will encounter some Forged, and DLC Raider-bots along with normal raiders, will encounter Triggermen in central Boston and so on.[/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=#ff7700]*[/color] Mod uses new mechanics to generate story faction spawns. That includes Minutemen patrols around the player owned settlements and Minutemen/BOS/Railroad patrols in central Boston and Cambridge areas. Minutemen settlement based patrols will become more numerous and expand their patrol area further from their base, based on settlement population and happiness, while chances to see Railroad and BOS groups will depend on story progression.[/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=#ff7700]*[/color] Adjusted encounter zones, with increased enemy levels, while moving from the Sanctuary corner to the south, for the Quincy and Glowing Sea Areas. Increased levels dramatically rise the chance to see mobs, that are greater than your current level, meaning not any fight can be won, forcing you make new tactical decisions based on enemies you encounter.[/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=#ff7700]*[/color] Mod completely overhauls the Glowing Sea area, which will be populated by the most dangerous enemies, such as swarms of Supermutants, deathclaws, robots, children of atom and ghouls. That place is a dangerous warzone, as it was intended to be.[/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#ff7700]*[/color][size=3] In overall,mod content includes about 50000 of new placed NPC’s and creatures, around 1500 of new group spawn points and patrol routes in common CW area, around 200 group spawn points and patrol routes in cites, and around 200 Minutemen settlement based conditional patrol groups/routes.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=#ff7700]*[/color] New in 1.2 - Several new Railroad and Synth weapon and outfit loadouts. New outfits for higher class Railroad Agents. Also, faction vertibirds.

Not sure with later versions, but SMB92 has provided us with an updated .esp to get the mod running again with latest DLCs[/color]\n<br />\n<br />[/b]If you are unfamiliar with modding, please read [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/videos/87/?]this[/url] to learn how to enable mods. You can use NMM to handle install process for you, or you can install the mod manually, using the following general method:[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=#ff7700]1.[/color][/size][/b][size=3] Extract the contents of the provided mod archive file into your Fallout4/Data folder. [/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=#ff7700]2.[/color][/size][/b][size=3] Navigate to/Users/Username/AppData/local/Fallout4 folder. [/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=#ff7700]3.[/color][/size][/b][size=3] Right-click on plugins.txt and remove the Read Only flag. [/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=#ff7700]4.[/color][/size][/b][size=3] Open plugins.txt and add '*CSE_V2_WOTC.esp' (without quotes, but with * symbol) into the end of the list. [/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=#ff7700]5.[/color][/size][/b][size=3] Save and re-flag plugins.txt as Read Only. [/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=#ff7700]6.[/color][/size][/b][size=3] Run the game. \n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffd966][b]Important note:[/b][/color] This mod is resource intensive and extensively uses papyrus scripting. To assure maximum performance and stability it is best to install mod in conflict-resolved setup (by means of [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/2737/?]FO4Edit[/url]) and start a new game.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][s]Also, due to the changes in game play, it is imperative to address the no sprint problem, caused by modifying game Cells. This problem is common to any mod that changes these, and is important to fix this up since you will probably be sprinting a lot. To fix sprinting bug, place the following entry in your Fallou4.ini and Fallout4Custom.ini, located in /Documents/My Games/Fallout4 folder. This problem has been resolved by Bethesda.[/s] [color=#f1c232]If you are experiencing this issue still, it is because you have problems with a mod you have installed affecting the cell you experience it in. Having the \"No Previs\" flag marked in a cell that actually has working Precom meshes will cause this.\n<br />[/color][/size][quote][size=3][color=#b6b6b6][Gameplay][/color]\n<br />fPlayerDisableSprintingLoadingCellDistance=0[/size][/quote][size=3]\n<br />[line]\n<br />[b][color=#ffd966]Detailed feature description / Menu Settings.[/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#ff7700]Presets (menu 0).[/color][/b] This menu is self-explanatory. I had added some settings here you can use to get what you want without setting things up by yourself. However, i want to specially note that these preset settings will not suit everyone, and the better way to configure this mod is to set your personal settings !!! Some of settings in other menus are important in terms of gameplay change and feel they bring to your game. Pay the special attention to switch on or off general enemy patrols, setting these to off will bring experience close to my old CSE mod, while turning them on will make hell break loose and turn CW into warzone area.[color=#1e84cc] [/color][color=#ffff00]Don't use the presets blindly, take some time to set up settings that will suit you play![/color]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#ff7700]Spawnpoint Frequency (menu 1).[/color][/b] Area density is the main instrument to control number of spawned groups. Internally mod uses very dense spawn maps, containing a large number of possible spawn positions, while the area density setting controls probability applied on loading, for each point of this grid to become active and spawn the enemy group. Random nature of this selection process is center of dynamic spawning feature, allowing different group placements each time player enters the area. Of course higher area density means that more enemy groups will spawn, leading to additional demand on user’s PC performance, required to maintain path finding and combat AI of placed enemy NPCs. It is advised not to use high area density settings on low performance machines, since it will lead to notable drop in game performance and stability. High-density setting can also break gameplay for some people since where will be many enemies all around. \n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#ff7700]Number Of Units In Groups (menu 2).[/color][/b] Group sizes is another major setting that controls the generated population, despite of the self-explanatory name of this setting, it’s work is not so simple as one can think. Each spawn point added by the mod can produce groups of different sizes, and one to be used is selected based on setting set in the control menus for corresponding area (2.1-2.4). This simple behavior exists only then random group size chance is set to zero in the Dynamic group sizes submenu (2.0), if corresponding value is not zero, this random chance will be applied each time spawn point is activated to make deviations from uniformly set group size. Dynamic group size modifier is simply a chance of ANY group to be random in size, selected based on the value, provided by the random number generator. So setting for example medium group sizes as the main setting with 25% random chance will lead to 75% medium size groups and 25% random size groups. Setting chance to 100% will mean that all groups, that are generated by the mod will have random sizes, setting to 0 will lead to fixed group sizes at all times. So, these settings have a long way, as it comes to enemy spawn diversity, and should be set properly to maintain desired degree of randomness. \n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#ff7700]Story faction spawns (menu 3).[/color][/b] This menu controls the special mod features related to story faction spawns. Minutemen (and other story faction) patrols will be available in the surroundings of any settlement controlled by player. Number of active patrol routes will depend on number of people in the base settlement and their happiness and is capped by maximum of 7 patrols. Exact value of active patrols generated by settlement depend on (Number of settlers * happiness / 100) score: value from 3 to 4 will unlock 1 patrol, 5 – 6 two patrols, 7 – 9 three patrols, 9 - 10 (4 patrols), 11-12 (5 patrols), 13 – 15 (6 patrols, while score greater than 15 will activate all 7 patrols. Lower 2 patrols will always make circles around the settlement, simulating sort of the security force, while other 5 will be away from the settlement, going further away from settlement, expanding its control area. Patrols active on higher score will also have more units, up to 8-9 on the top ones. Most of the patrols will be Minutemen, but could also be other story factions, once player is their member (BOS/Rail/Synth). You could also set a chance, that will be used to select non-Minutemen faction settlement patrol in submenu (3.1). Increase in number of controlled settlements will also raise the chance of Minutemen spawns in all CW areas, the maximum value of this chance could be set using submenu (3.0). That chance will be applied to ALL NPC spawn points in the CW countryside areas, and on successful RNG roll will replace spawn of enemy group with spawn of Minutemen recon team. Other important faction settings are minimum (submenu 3.2) and maximum (submenu 3.3) chances of story factions inside the central Boston and Cambridge. On successful RNG roll against these chances, enemy spawns within cities will be replaced by some story faction (MM/BOS/Railroad). Chance of spawning exact story faction depends on current faction status. For example, Brotherhood patrols will be relatively frequent only on airship arrival, Minutemen chance will rise with number of controlled settlements, while railroad chance will be set to sum of some constant chance and railroad story progression (bos/inst destroyed, player membership). As all other spawns in the mod, story faction spawns will do patrolling.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#ff7700]Group Patrol Settings (menu 4).[/color][/b] Patrols are one of the most distinctive features of the mod, and have a big contribution for gameplay dynamic. Area you are in may seem void and clear, and when, all the sudden you can find yourself in the big fight with unexpected enemy patrol headed you way. All other enemy groups are on patrols as well and some of them will gladly join your little party this first one and so on. These multiple patrols crossings makes the core of the mod experience, making it fell like a real war is going on in the CW. Multiple sided faction fights will be common all around the CW, some of them can reach a really epic scales. While patrols are certainly good in bringing new game experience, they are also place more pressure on game engine. If, at some point you want to increase game performance, or want experience close to my old CSE mod, you can turn these off using corresponding submenu.  \n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#ff7700]Group Respawn Timers (menu 5).[/color][/b] This menu control mod’s respawning timers, these will have huge effect depending on other spawning settings. Original game resets cells on regular basis using 168-hour delay for normal cells and 480 in game hours for ‘cleared’ locations. Since this mod adds new spawns not existent in normal game, and have several groups loaded to any spawn point, it cannot use internal game respawning mechanism properly. For example if where will be no re-population time control, mod will generate new groups each time you come close to spawn point, never matter if you cleared this area just a hour ago. This means that areas will never be cleared of enemies (in reality clearing is possible, if you kill all groups placed into one spawn point, until game normal respawn timer ticks out). To control the flow of spawned units mod uses it’s own respawn timer to determine whenever the spawn point should be repopulated. Where are separate settings here for CW countryside (submenu 5.0), spawns in city areas (submenu 5.1) and settlement patrols (5.2). Setting shorter timers and especially setting it to 0 will result in huge increase of population in the corresponding zones. In addition, due to increased demand on cleaning of used game assets, and to affect overall mod dynamic, normal game engine cell respawn timers set to 6 hours for normal cells and to 24 hours for ‘cleared’ cells. \n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#ff7700]Spawn Limiter (menu 6).[/color][/b] This is somewhat advanced setting, allowing you to set limit for number of spawned groups, that could be active at the same time. This setting will be applied on the top of all other settings, and will deny all spawns higher then set limit, it will not care the type of spawn that is being requested. This setting can be used for total population control independent from other settings and at least provides the way for people with low PC performance to set the limits, suitable for their machine. By default limiter is to unrestricted after 1.1b version, since turning the limit on will dramatically affect the measure of chaos you will see in CW. For best experience i recommend not to turn this on and leave alone default unrestricted settings, however one can still use this if needed. Use this setting wisely.\n<br />\n<br />[line]\n<br />[b][color=#ffd966]Compatibility, stability and savefile size.[/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />Please note, that mods relies heavily on game engine performance, and uses heavy scripting to get things running, so take care on the load order you are using, do not overtax your game by giant mod lists and high number of resource intensive mods. Failing to do this can ruin the game stability and lead to some bugs or crashes without the apparent reason. Stability and performance of this mod will be directly proportional to the level of purity in conflict resolution it your mod load order (note below).\n<br />\n<br />It's recommended that all players start on medium settings and adjust to a level that's right for your game play style. This is especially true for users on slower computers. When using this mod at its higher settings, slower computers might encounter severe frame rate reduction due to the immense amount of pure chaos taking place within your game. This can also lead to CTD issues if the game is overtaxed on slower PCs.  If you start having CTD issues, the first thing you should do is lower the spawn settings.\n<br />\n<br />In general mod inter compatibility depends from whatever the do edit the same things in their corresponding plugin files, if multiple mods edit the same thing that leads to conflict, resulting in instability and frequent or permanent crashes. If crash does not happen, that does not mean that all is good, mods can still be screwed by each other. On multiple edits of the same thing game will use the values placed by the mod what was loaded last, overwriting edits made by other mods. \n<br />\n<br />This mod places many new objects into the worldspace, so it alters many Cells to place them into the game world. Any mod, altering Cells WILL conflict with any other that also changes them. The only compatibility possible here is to make all mods never edit the same cells, changing only different ones. There are hundreds of Cell changing mods up where, so where is really no physical chance to make compatibility patches for them all. In such cases, as in all other cases of mod conflicts one should use excellent toll [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/2737/?]FO4Edit[/url] to resolve the conflicts. To learn how to do that, one could use excellent video tutorial by the CrussBoss it could be found here: [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oG2jlSLptY]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oG2jlSLptY[/url]\n<br />\n<br />Before making any blame for crashes on the mod author make sure that you understand notes above, and make sure you used appropriate mod setup. The tips above are general ones and apply to all mods out where, so take care to resolve your mod conflicts in FO4Edit first, before blaming someone in the bugs section. \n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#ff7700]Note on saved games:[/color] [/b]Since this mod adds many new object into the game world, and game engine have edited cells vector loaded into memory all the times, it also means the appropriate increase of savegame file size. Exact same reason applies to increased game loading time. More content require more resources, where is no way around that. Please take a special note, that such increase in save file size due to added Cell content have nothing to do with the famous savegame ‘bloating’ problem, caused by engine and script junk, persistently moving from one save to another, even their parent problem making mods are removed from your load order. Save files with this mod will be much larger then normal, but this does not mean that saves are bloated and will become unreadable. This is not the case here.\n<br />\n<br />[line]\n<br />[b][color=#ffd966]Tactical advice[/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />With a lot more enemies around, game play becomes much more resource and ammo demanding.  Ammo will be worth it's weight in gold.  Depending on the spawn setting, one will quickly realise that you can't kill everything, and that fighting one group of enemies can attract another, leading to you being surrounded and getting killed. That is where the true enjoyment part comes in, and it comes in the form of tactical game play, creating more decision making: who should you fight and when, should you retreat or risk being flanked or surrounded, do you have enough ammo and stims to reach your map destination and many more decisions like that. This leaves you with a vast variety of choices, that can literally cost you your life while exploring the wastes. So the main advice here is to use your head for route planning, use tactics and stealth to dispose or avoid enemy groups, use any of your perk advantages (like some good melee stats will save you a lot of ammo, aqua boy will allow water safe travel and so on). Use your settlements not for decoration, but as safe zones, where you can heal your wounds, resupply and rest. There are many ways to conquer the new wasteland hazards, and final choices are all up to you.[/size]\n<br />[size=3] [/size]\n<br />[b][size=3][color=#ff7700]*[/color][/size][/b][size=3] When facing weak mobs, it may be wise to conserve your ammo and use melee weapons instead. Use area attacks to break clustered enemies, your grenades and explosives are much more valuable here. [/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=#ff7700]*[/color][/size][/b][size=3] With the level of difficulty this mod provides, try to avoid enemies or disengage from a fight when you feel drastically outnumbered/ outgunned/ surrounded. [/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=#ff7700]*[/color][/size][/b][size=3] Take care to listen to your surroundings for distant gunfire that may tell you where you should go, and what area you wish to avoid. Try to stay alert and do some recon before you enter large open land areas. [/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=#ff7700]*[/color][/size][/b][size=3] Always use terrain to your advantage, don't take a stand in a place with no cover. Use a jetpack to get to positions unreachable by the enemy, use mines and lure. Protect your flanks and back. Always be on the lookout for the places, which can be useful in making a stand in case of facing overwhelming odds, and for possible escape routes. [/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=#ff7700]*[/color][/size][/b][size=3] Keep in mind that you don't have to fight every enemy you see or hear. They'll usually fight it out amongst another group nearby, this might give you the opportunity to sneak by undetected, or possibly lure one group of enemies into another while you collect all what’s left after they kill each other. [/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=#ff7700]*[/color][/size][/b][size=3] Flank enemy groups engaging each other, selecting the side intended to win as your target. When the fight is coming to the end, shoot them in their backs, to eliminate all remaining resistance if necessary.

The exception is the Unofficial Patch which should be placed before this in your load order so that the additional script changes made by Workshop Framework will overwrite the UFO4P versions. \n<br />\n<br />[size=4]New in 2020 - Settlement Layout System[/size]\n<br />[center][youtube]N3MGiari9xc[/youtube][/center]\n<br />[center][youtube]9OVzgFzjnRw[/youtube][/center]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]Overall Goal[/size]\n<br />\n<br />The goal of Workshop Framework is to open up the settlement system so we can do more interesting things with it.\n<br />\n<br />Adjusting most of the behavior of settlements requires adjusting the Workshop scripts - and as soon as you do that, you are incompatible with all other mods that want to edit that same script. Since the Settlements are controlled with just a few scripts - many things you may have thought would be simple, basically never got made into mods because people don't want to deal with the hassle of having edited vanilla scripts.\n<br />\n<br />No more! Workshop Framework completely rewrites many of the base workshop scripts and introduces tons of hooks, new options, and eliminates most hard-coded variables so that tons of mod authors can release mods editing just the part of the settlement system they want to change.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]Easy-to-Use Advanced Systems[/size]\n<br />\n<br />On top of opening up the scripts, I've added several advanced systems presented in a simple way, so that even people without a massive programming background can contribute new mods and functionality that add very powerful changes to settlements. For example, much of the code that makes the Sim Settlements City Plan's work is now a core system in Workshop Framework so that anyone with a little bit of coding experience can dynamically place large swathes of objects in a settlement on the fly!\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]Design Philosophy[/size]\n<br />\n<br />When designing this, it was important to me that the core gameplay functionality of settlements is completely unaltered by this framework. If you install this in your game, you should notice no difference other than the few bugs it fixes and an overall performance increase with settlement related activities. All gameplay options are left intact, and always will be.\n<br />\n<br />That said, somethings will work wildly different behind the scenes in order to open new options for adjustment, so while players can safely install this without thinking about it, if you are a mod author - you are likely very concerned about what this is doing! So to alleviate your fears, I offer the following:\n<br />\n<br />- I have not altered any vanilla property or function signatures. If you are currently expecting a function or property from the existing workshop scripts - it's still there, so your code will not break.\n<br />\n<br />- I will never alter property names or function signatures of anything in Workshop Framework now that it is released. Any time I'm forced to adjust a function, I will leave the original version in tact and simply point it to the updated version. This way you can be confident your mods based on WSFW will continue to work from version to version.\n<br />\n<br />- I will do everything in my power to keep this code bug-free, and am open to suggestions and improvements to the code base so that we can all have a flexible, powerful core to work from.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]Documentation[/size]\n<br />\n<br />For complete documentation, head to the [url=https://github.com/kinggath/WorkshopFramework]Github repo[/url].\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]Demo Mod[/size]\n<br />\n<br />The optional file is a demo mod, not meant for widespread usage. It is designed to show the potential of certain parts of the code, and allow people who want to see these features expanded on and improved test them out quickly to help give me feedback and bug reports.\n<br />\n<br />v1.0.0 - All friendly NPCs will have an alternate activation called Recruit. This will allow you to convert virtually any NPC to a settler and send them to one of your settlements. (This is made possible by a code overhaul in version 2.0.0 of Workshop Framework). Note that these NPCs will not work with Sim Settlements plots due to the way plots are coded currently (this will change in some future version of Sim Settlements).\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]Open Source and Permissions\n<br />[/size]\n<br />While this is open-source, and anyone has permission to make use of pieces of code found inside of these scripts, please do not release new versions of the exact same named scripts, or release things based on the code that would interfere with what this mod is trying to achieve. The idea is that this framework will become a central staple we can all build on without compatibility issues.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]The Future[/size]\n<br />\n<br />- Continue Improving the speed and stability of the Workshop scripts.\n<br />- Flesh out and expand the API.\n<br />- Add more hooks to allow doing other things the community dreams up (drop by the Github repo to join in the discussion or even get in on the development!).\n<br />- Add additional advanced systems that more mod authors can take advantage of to add extra functionality to their mods without the need for a programming background.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]Special Thanks[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/users/106891?tab=user+files]1000101[/url] - For helping me develop the threading system and allowing me to use his thread locking code!\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/users/684492]Arthmoor[/url] and the rest of the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/4598]Unofficial Patch team[/url] for allowing me to use their Workshop fixes!\n<br />\n<br />Woodfuzzy, Krazyhorse, and Moonbeam for testing the crap out of this so I could feel comfortable releasing it...",

If you'd like to contribute to the mod or get some ideas of how you can tap into Workshop Framework (which was used as the foundation for WS+) head to the [url=https://github.com/kinggath/Workshop-Plus]Github repository[/url]﻿![/size]\n<br />[size=4]\n<br />God Simulator[/size]\n<br />\n<br />Workshop Plus will turn you into an invisible hand in the game world [b]while you are in workshop mode[/b]. All of the options below can be turned off.\n<br />\n<br />- [b]Flight[/b]: You actually fly while in Workshop Mode, no tcl necessary. This means you can still interact with things over and over without having to toggle tcl on and off.\n<br />\n<br />- [b]Super Speed[/b]: You move incredibly fast while in Workshop Mode, to quickly get to the sections of the settlement you want to work on. Can be set to +50%, +100%, or +200%.\n<br />\n<br />- [b]Invulnerability[/b]: You won't take damage, or more importantly rads while in Workshop Mode - no more accidental death when working on your settlements.\n<br />\n<br />- [b]Invisibility[/b]: You will be completely ignored by NPCs while in Workshop Mode, so you can focus on your building. This also gives you the power to convert the game into full blown Tower Defense with the appropriate mods.\n<br />\n<br />- [b]Free Build[/b]: No more building materials required to build and bypasses perk requirements on workshop objects (they will still show the lock icon but can be built anyway). This option defaults to OFF because it prevents scrapping from returning resources which would be confusing.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]Hotkeys (Require MCM)[/size]\n<br />\n<br />- [b]Clone[/b]: Pick up an item, press a key, you have a copy. If you have Place Everywhere, this even works with things you don't have construction records for - that means you can clone every item in the game, even normally scrap only things, or props and buildings from Sim Settlements!\n<br />\n<br />- [b]Undo/Redo[/b]: Over 1000 levels of undo support! Set up hotkeys and you can undo movements, placements, and scrapping with the press of a button. \n<br />\n<br />   ﻿Notes on Undo/Redo \n<br />   ﻿    ﻿- If you undo the movement of a wired object, the wire will still be where it was when you moved the object - you'll need to reattach the wire yourself - but the power will still run even if you don't.\n<br />   ﻿   ﻿- Each time you enter a new settlement, your undo history is cleared.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]Layers[/size]\n<br />\n<br />Layers allow you to separate items and quickly hide or even duplicate them! This gives you the power of programs like Photoshop in your settlement. \n<br />\n<br />- [b]Multiple Layers[/b]: Up to 16 layers per settlement (1 is the default layer)\n<br />\n<br />- [b]Duplication[/b]: Entire Layers can be duplicated, allowing you to create a structure, make a copy, and then thanks to the toggle Display/Linking move your copy all at once anywhere you want in your settlement!\n<br />\n<br />- [b]Deletion[/b]: Transfer items between layers or even scrap them all in one go!\n<br />\n<br />- [b]Visual HUD[/b]:  [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/20309]HUDFramework[/url] integration to provide a visual module to help you use the Layers system.\n<br />\n<br />-[b] Toggle Display[/b]: Hide all of the items on a layer instantly, then re-display them again just as quickly.\n<br />\n<br />- [b]Toggle Linking[/b]: Unlinked items won't be picked up by Group Select, so you can separate out your items on to different levels so you can pull out the groups of items you want and move them in a group.\n<br />\n<br />- [b]Highlighting[/b]: Highlighting tools and toggles help you quickly identify which of your items are on a given layer.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]Workshop Save*[/size]\n<br />\n<br />*While this isn't the holy grail of being able to actually save in workshop mode and avoid having to wait for the transition - it can at least save you some steps and hopefully prevent you from ever losing much work in your design when the game engine decides to crash.\n<br />\n<br />- Automatically exits you from workshop mode, and then puts you back in when it finishes saving.\n<br />\n<br />- Hotkey available with MCM.\n<br />\n<br />- Autosave option allows you to set a certain amount of time in Workshop mode where the game will automatically save.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=6]How To Use[/size]\n<br />\n<br />The \"God Simulator\" things will happen automatically when you enter Workshop Mode. To control the options, either access the MCM menu, or if you aren't using it, go to a Chem Workbench and craft the Workshop Plus Controls holotape under Utility.\n<br />\n<br />To use the Layer system without hotkeys, go to a Chem Workbench and craft the Layer Control Module under Utility. You can Favorite this item and activate it to bring up options. \n<br />\n<br />MCM allows you to use hotkeys in Workshop mode and is definitely the preferred way to control layers - so if you find it obnoxious to jump in and out of Workshop mode to work with layers - grab MCM and set up those hotkeys!\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]The Future\n<br />\n<br />[/size]- Continue to expand on the features available to make Workshop Mode feel more and more like a creative tool.\n<br />- Copy layers to other settlements.\n<br />- Export layers for importing into different save files.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]Special Thanks[/size]\n<br />\n<br />The [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/28599]Rise of the Commonwealth[/url] team for constantly bitching about how bad Workshop Mode is, which inspired me to make this! \n<br />\n<br />Woodfuzzy, Krazyhorse, and Moonbeam for testing the crap out of this so I could feel comfortable releasing it...",

            "description": "[b]What it does?[/b]\n<br />Allows preload F4SE plugins before the game initializes.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Do I need this and is there any benefit to this?[/b]\n<br />No! You don't need this unless a mod specifically says you require this. There is no benefit to having this for no reason. At the time of writing this you only need it if you use [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/33947]PrivateProfileRedirector F4[/url] or [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/47359]Buffout 4[/url]. There is no other reason to use this at all. It allows the mod to make edit to game code before the game has any chance to run that code.\n<br />\n<br />[b]How does it work?[/b]\n<br />Library [font=Courier New]IpHlpAPI.dll[/font] is loaded by game automatically, which preloads the plugins, then redirects all function calls to the original [font=Courier New]IpHlpAPI.dll[/font] file in your system directory.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Installation[/b]\n<br />Put [font=Courier New]IpHlpAPI.dll[/font] and [font=Courier New]xSE PluginPreloader.xml[/font] in your root Fallout 4 directory (where [font=Courier New]Fallout4.exe[/font] is), NOT in the Data folder.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Uninstallation[/b]\n<br />Delete installed files from your game folder. Any mod that depends on this will cease to work correctly.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Configuration\n<br />[/b]Preloader is implemented as proxy to [font=Courier New]IpHlpAPI.dll[/font] and thus is incompatible with any mod that changes this DLL (none I found). In such case you need to rename another mod [font=Courier New]IpHlpAPI.dll[/font] to something else and specify new real DLL in [font=Courier New]xSE PluginPreloader.xml[/font] file. Refer to the XML file for more detailed instructions.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff0000][size=6][b]ATTENTION![/b][/size][/color]\n<br />[size=5]Go to the [font=Courier New]xSE PluginPreloader.xml[/font] file and change the load method to [font=Courier New]OnThreadAttach[/font] or [/size][font=Courier New][size=5]ImportAddressHook[/size][/font][size=5] if the default doesn't work.\n<br />\n<br />- If you're using [b]Mod Organizer 2[/b] you [i]probably[/i] need to use [/size][font=Courier New][size=5]OnThreadAttach[/size][/font][size=5] (was called \"delayed\" before v0.2).\n<br />- If you're using [b]Vortex[/b] to install mods use [b]Injector[/b] install method ([b]DINPUT[/b] for older Vortex versions).\n<br />\n<br />To change the load method, edit the value of the \"Name\" attribute in the XML file.[/size]\n<br />[code]&lt;LoadMethod Name=\"OnProcessAttach\"&gt;\n<br />    ...\n<br />&lt;/LoadMethod&gt;\n<br />[/code]\n<br />[size=5]For example, if you need to set it to \"OnThreadAttach\" or \"[/size]ImportAddressHook[size=5]\" edit this section like this.[/size]\n<br />[code]\n<br />&lt;LoadMethod Name=\"OnThreadAttach\"&gt;\n<br />    ...\n<br />&lt;/LoadMethod&gt;\n<br />[/code][code]﻿&lt;LoadMethod Name=\"ImportAddressHook\"&gt;\n<br />    ...\n<br />&lt;/LoadMethod&gt;[/code]\n<br />[b]User Q&amp;A[/b]\n<br />Q: Does this have a performance hit or any downsides?\n<br />A: Nothing that have been noticed.\n<br />\n<br />Q: Is it compatible with ENB?\n<br />A: Yes.\n<br />\n<br />Q: Is ENB required?\n<br />A: No.\n<br />\n<br />Q: Doesn't it mess up things if you load F4SE plugins at different time?\n<br />A: Only F4SE plugins that have included a special file, indicating that they wish to load earlier, will be preloaded. You should not manually create the file. Plugin author will decide this and include the file with their mod if it must be loaded like that.\n<br />\n<br />Q: I'm having issues where a plugin is not preloaded when it's supposed to!\n<br />A: Find file [font=Courier New]xSE PluginPreloader.log[/font] in your game directory and upload it with your issue report. I'll try to find out what's wrong.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Mod author Q&amp;A[/b]\n<br />Q: How do I make my plugin load before game initializes?\n<br />A: Let's say your plugin name is [font=Courier New]MyPlugin.dll[/font] and it's in Data/F4SE/Plugins, then you create a text file called [font=Courier New]MyPlugin_preload.txt[/font] in [font=Courier New]Data/F4SE/Plugins[/font], [b]the contents of the file does [i]not[/i] matter[/b].\n<br />\n<br />Q: How is the plugin loaded?\n<br />A: The [font=Courier New]IpHlpAPI.dll [/font]loader will call [font=Courier New]LoadLibrary [/font]on your plugin before game initializes. It does NOT call [font=Courier New]F4SEPlugin_Query[/font] or [font=Courier New]F4SEPlugin_Load[/font], those are called later by the F4SE itself. That means you must do whatever it is you need to do before the game initializes in your [font=Courier New]DllMain[/font] method. You can also export a function with name [font=Courier New]Initialize[/font] (with signature [font=Courier New][color=#6d9eeb]void[/color]([color=#6d9eeb]__cdecl[/color]*)([color=#6d9eeb]void[/color])[/font], i.e. no parameters, no return value, C calling convention) to be called after.\n<br />\n<br />Q: F4SE later calls [font=Courier New]LoadLibrary[/font] again, is that a problem?\n<br />A: No, [font=Courier New]LoadLibrary[/font] can be called multiple times and will only load the DLL once, unless it's in multiple locations as different files.\n<br />\n<br />Q: Can I install my plugin files (including the _preload.txt) via Mod Organizer/Wrye Bash?\n<br />A: Original SKSE Plugin Preloader page says that you can. Considering that plugin packaging is identical, I think it's applicable. Same with Wrye Bash:\n<br />be sure to tell users to choose \"Override Skips\" on the installer so that the .txt installs along with your F4SE plugin\n<br />\n<br />Plugin source is available on [url=https://github.com/KerberX/xSE-PluginPreloader]GitHub[/url].\n<br />\n<br />Credits:\n<br />Nukem - Detours library\n<br />meh321 - description template\n<br />Augh - testing.",

Please wait for official Fallout 4 patches.\r<br />\r<br />[b]How do I run this?\r<br />[/b]This is a standalone executable, installing via NMM will help you with update notifications, but you need to launch this program yourself manually. You can do this by either downloading this file manually and putting it on your computer (Desktop/documents/etc) or download it with the Nexus Mod Manager and run it from the Fallout4&#92;Data folder.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Where are your changelogs?\r<br />[/b]Changelogs are always updated and are located on the &#34;changes&#34; tab on this mod page.\r<br />\r<br />[b]This wont start?&#33; WHY?[/b]\r<br />Try running this as administrator. If that doesn&#39;t work send me a screenshot of the error message. If you don&#39;t get an error message check Windows Event Viewer for more information.\r<br />\r<br />[b]I cannot launch this tool&#33; Windows Event Viewer blames [/b][b]d3d9.dll. Why?[/b]\r<br />Sounds like you&#39;re running RIVA Statistics tuner / MSI Afterburner. That software can cause incompatibilities with some .net applications. Please turn this software off or add this application as an exception to fix this error.\r<br />\r<br />[b]After using this tool I cannot edit settings in game?&#33; WTF?&#33;\r<br />[/b]This tool sets your configs to read only to prevent the game from overwriting the tweaks. If you want to edit your settings you can either press &#34;Edit Launcher settings&#34; or if you want to edit in game, go to settings and turn off read only mode and press save.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Where is Mouse Acceleration? \r<br />[/b]Mouse Acceleration was removed long ago because the setting assumed to turn it off (bForceIgnoreSmoothness) is actually a texture setting in Fallout4. There is no acceleration setting for this game.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Does this work with F4SE?\r<br />[/b]This works with any executable you want. Just go in Settings and change the executable to the program you want to use.\r<br />\r<br />[b]How do I Uninstall?\r<br />[/b]First, to revert your INI back to default, go into Settings &gt; Restore Backup INI.  If you&#39;re using this app as your default launcher, also make sure to press &#34;Click to Restore Original Launcher&#34;. Then, simply delete this program.\r<br />\r<br />[b]My terminal is broken&#33; Minigames are too fast&#33; Wierd things happening in game that shouldn&#39;t. Help&#33;\r<br />[/b]By turning off framerate lock(vsync) the game physics will become completely unreliable. Make sure to lock the framerates yourself by setting a cap (Nvidia Inspector) or turn on vsync in AMD/NVidia Control panel.\r<br />\r<br />[b]THIS IS A VIRUS&#33;&#33;&#33;111oneone\r<br />[/b]This is not a virus. I perform many tasks ranging from editng file attributes (Read Only mode), modifying the Registry (CPU Priority tweak), and accessing files in your Programs directory (Default game install directory). These actions + not being a AAA software developer, some AV products will flag my tool as potentially malicious as a CYA.\r<br />\r<br />[b]MY SAVES ARE GONE&#33;&#33;[/b]\r<br />You created a new save profile in the launcher without checking &#34;Import existing saves&#34; so you will have to manually move your saves from the Backup_Saves folder in Documents&#92;My Games&#92;Fallout 4&#92; to Documents&#92;My Games&#92;Fallout 4&#92;Profiles&#92;ProfileName&#92;\r<br />\r<br />[b]MipMap Fix is forcing my textures to Medium&#33;&#33;&#33;\r<br />[/b]The vanilla launcher isnt designed to accept custom values so it freaks out and displays an erroneous texture value. I assure you, its not setting textures to medium.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Can you add xxxx feature?\r<br />[/b]Please PM me feature requests, as its near impossible for me to keep track of feature requests in the discussions forum. \r<br />\r<br />[b]What does xxxx feature do?\r<br />[/b]Before asking this, please hover your mouse over the option to see what I wrote. 99% change if you ask me, i&#39;ll give you the exact same description as in the program.",

IT DOES AFFECT ALL NPCs EVEN FROM OTHER MODS.\r<br />\r<br />It will work retroactively: if you use this mod on your current game, people you already have talked to will not be called &#34;Stranger&#34;.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />I will probabky make more Fallout 4 mods, but as my computer is becoming quite old, I will have difficulty testing them. This is why I have been looking for a job IRL: to get funds for a new computer (and a new home, and a potential future baby, and who cares &#39;bout my life).\r<br />\r<br />Here is the mighty wall of donators.

Configurable service charge and health restore options.\n<br />[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ff00][center][size=3][ all Papyrus scripts are digitally remastered in full 4K UHD with 7.1 surround ] [/size][/center][/color]\n<br />[size=3] \n<br />Install this mod at any time in any game stage for any game difficulty (including survival) and the player is given a regenerating [color=#00ff00][ .SKK pLAYERuNDEAD ] [/color]menu item in AID inventory after exiting V111 (craft spares at the Chemlab). When the item is activated, a menu pops for:\n<br />\n<br /> \n<br />Service state: [ Enable | Disable ]\n<br />Service fee: [ 0% | 50% | 100% ] of player caps.\n<br />Restore [ 10% | 50% | 100% ]  of player health.\n<br /> \n<br /> \n<br />[b]User Notes (RTFM)\n<br />[/b]\n<br />When PlayerUndead™ is enabled, the player is configured to be essential with no bleedout recovery (like a companion) so they don't actually die.\n<br />\n<br />After bleeding out the player can chose to recover in place or to the nearest owned workshop (that is not being attacked by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/37393]Settlement Attack System[/url]).\n<br />\n<br />If there are no registered owned workshops in the worldspace or interior, the player is recovered to Sanctuary because ownership of that workshop should never be lost. If Sanctuary is a hostile Conquerer settlement, that's on you.\n<br />\n<br />If the player has a companion using the standard companion slot who is also bleeding out, they are moved with the player so they don't try to bail and return to their home location.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]Known Issues[/b]\n<br />\n<br />(1) If the player dies whilst in VATS the imagespace animations freeze and death can not be recovered. Reload from save. \n<br />\n<br />(2) In some areas of the world bad surface/navmesh can cause the \"[i]player the bleeding out on the ground[/i]\" idle animation to fall through the world, or the 3rd person camera to become stuck. Reload from save.\n<br />\n<br />(3) When actors are bleeding out they are actually marked as dead so they are no longer attacked. This can cause other actors to loot their weapons and ammo during bleedout. If your stuff is not on a dead hostile, check your companion.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]Compatibility\n<br />\n<br />[/b](1) The mod has no dependencies on extenders or DLCs. \n<br />\n<br />(2) There is one change to a base game asset: MGEF [font=Courier New]RestoreRadsCompanion[/font] to avoid Stimpaks healing rads on the player whilst they are essential. It will conflict with anything that modifies the effect.\n<br />\n<br />(3) If the mod detects that the player is already essential when the [color=#00ff00][ .SKK pLAYERuNDEAD ] [/color]menu item is activated, it will pop a warning message that it can't continue. Things known to already manage the player essential state are Death Matters, Horizon, Follower Revive System, Zombie Walkers and Fallout 4-76 PlayerUndead™ option.\n<br />\n<br />(4) This mod should be compatible with multiple companion/follower mods if you use the \"recover in place\" option. It will not be compatible if you use the \"recover to nearest workshop option\" as it doesn't know about the additional headcount to manage their bleedout state and move them with the player.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[/size][size=3][b]PC Console configuration[/b][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]If additional inventory items trigger you, no problem throw it away and use the console, hotkeys.ini or create an MCM json thing:[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[font=Courier New][size=2]set SKK_PUEnabled to 1       ;; options [0 | 1]\n<br />set SKK_PUCapsCharge to 0    ;; range [0 to 1] decimal percent of player total caps. \n<br />set SKK_PURestoreHealth to 1 ;; range [0.1 to 1] decimal percent of player total health (do not set to zero).\n<br />cqf SKK_PUQuest \"SKK_PUQuestScript.SwitchPlayerUndead\" ;; call this for enable/disable to take effect[/size][/font]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]\n<br />[b]Nexus PC manual installation &amp; disable\n<br />\n<br />[/b]Copy SKKPlayerUndead.esp and  SKKPlayerUndead – Main.BA2 to your...&#92;Fallout 4&#92;Data directory and add to Plugins.txt, or enable in the Bethesda mod menu, use a mod manger or however you organise. \n<br />\n<br />Do not disable this mod if the service state is enabled, but when the service state is disabled the mod is idle and can be disabled in the load order. Only remove mods if you are happy to accept potential conflicts from load order changes in a save game. If that is unclear, best to be safe and don't ever remove mods from a savegame.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]Nexus FAQ[/b]\n<br />\n<br />(1) Why is there no ESL version ? Because life already contains sufficient hassle. \n<br />\n<br />(2) Why an aid item menu rather than MCM ? Because 90% of SKK mod users like to shoot stuff on Xbox.\n<br />\n<br />(3) It has been decided to not merge this function into [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/37963]SKK Dynamic Damage Manager[/url] because reasons.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ff00](4) Holdon pal, isn't this just a rip and republish of a feature from your massive [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/32599]Fallout 4-76 Open World[/url] overhaul mod ? Why Timmy, yes that's quite right ! Mainly because I need a lightweight no death solution based on scripts I trust more than your mommy when I am not in the 4-76 open world, but also a 4K UHD remaster of the original Papyrus scripts must be worth publishing standalone just like those HD nipples and 4K scrotum re-textures.

I&#39;ve dabbled in modding privately in past games, but this game has been my first foray on the scale that I have done. Your support and critiques kept me coming back and helped make this better (all 700+ endorsers, 13K+ downloaders, and 140+ comments).\r<br />\r<br />Right now, due to work commitments and other personal developments, I am officially done with supporting this project. I don&#39;t have the bandwidth to do it justice. As of now (10/21/16), this project is 100% open-source to anyone who wants to take it and roll with it. Keep it going or change it up - that can be up to you. If you&#39;ve enjoyed using this as much as I have, I hope you consider making it your own.\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;ve said it before and I&#39;ll say it again - BIG thank you to [url=https://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/user/65149-cooleo/]cooleo[/url].

([b]NOT[/b] affiliated with the Weaponsmith Extended mod).\r<br />\r<br />This mod does a deep dive series of changes to the existing modifications for ballistic firearms as pertains to receivers, fire modes, ammo types, and calibers.

The other? Orange.\r<br /> \r<br />Use this gun to ascend to new heights, perform daring raids, and annoy \r<br />settlers in endless loops.\r<br />If you can figure out how to solve puzzles or perform testing with it in\r<br /> this game, well, good for you.\r<br />\r<br />Here&#39;s how it works:\r<br />\r<br />Shoot one portal onto some object or surface, step close to it, and be \r<br />warped to the other portal.\r<br />Teleportation works between and within interiors, large exterior places,\r<br /> and in the Commonwealth at large.\r<br />\r<br />But be careful: watch where you warp&#33; \r<br />And it&#39;s not just you who can be transferred to the other side...\r<br />\r<br />Change portal colors by unequipping and reequipping the gun.\r<br />\r<br />Here&#39;s where you can find it:\r<br />\r<br />The Institute has wisely sequestered this awesome power in a place few \r<br />would think to look: its agents have secreted the gun and a special \r<br />holotape in Diamond City, in an ice machine which is itself in the Meat \r<br />Freezer atop Choice Chops&#33; \r<br />\r<br />Also from The Institute labs: Project Holdall, your holotape uplink to \r<br />convenient temporary remote storage of items in the Cloud (of radiation,\r<br /> that is).\r<br />\r<br />Equip the Portal Gun with the Loot Coprocessor to gain even more \r<br />irresponsible power: the power of taking everything in sight for later \r<br />retrieval at your convenience.\r<br />\r<br />In a word: &#34;Emergent&#34; gameplay&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[u][b]Manual type stuff:[/b][/u]\r<br />\r<br />[i]Installation[/i]\r<br />\r<br />No special instructions, archive contains 1 ESP and 2 BA2s.\r<br />Prior to uninstalling, make sure you clear out the remote inventory.\r<br />Its world location is next to the icebox where you get the gun.\r<br />\r<br />[i]Where is this thing specifically?[/i]\r<br />\r<br />For more specific guidance, when you first enter the middle of Diamond City (not the Stands),on the right is the All Faiths Chapel, and next to it is the butcher stand (Choice Chops).  If you&#39;ve got to the front door of the Dugout Inn you&#39;ve gone too far. You want to get on the roof of Choice Chops to access its meat locker (one way is to not completely go up to the stands and walk along the edge of the stadium seating). In \r<br />the Meat Locker is the ice container with the portal gun.  This is a small room with hanging meat and frost, so it&#39;s pretty distinctive once \r<br />you are inside.\r<br />\r<br />[i]How do I change portal colors?[/i]\r<br />\r<br />If you unequip and then re-equip the portal gun ([b]through the menu only[/b]) the colors on the gun should change. When it&#39;s blue, you should be able to fire a blue portal. Do the same to switch back to orange. Sometimes when a save loads, the right color mod\r<br /> might not be equipped; you should also be able to get back in proper phase by this same equipping and un-equipping.\r<br />\r<br />A melee bash (Alt) will also do this: this is the preferred method since it minimizes out-of-color-change phase cosmetic issues.\r<br />\r<br />As an easter egg, if you have a item in the world grabbed, then bash, if you release the grab it will throw the item out in front of you instead of just dropping.\r<br />\r<br />[i]General Cautions[/i]\r<br />\r<br />* If you use the remote storage, clear it out before you uninstall&#33;\r<br />* Dying, getting stuck, breaking NPC behaviors when you displace things, losing things is (WC4:) The Price of Freedom.  \r<br />\r<br />Some notes on buggy behavior and engine limitations:\r<br />\r<br />[i]Fast Travel and Jump[/i] / &#34;Falling&#34; Animation\r<br />\r<br />This glitchy behavior has been around for some time in the Havok enabled Gamebryo games...\r<br />\r<br />From time to time, a warp which results in an incomplete fall animation \r<br />will stick the player temporarily with a falling state. If you want to \r<br />fast travel or jump, these are things you cannot do while the game \r<br />thinks you are falling; another telltale sign is that the character may \r<br />also amusingly hold their hands up when interacting. This problem can \r<br />more rarely happen in the vanilla game in any situation in which you \r<br />fall abruptly or are ragdolled severely. Usually this issue is solved \r<br />pretty handily with this mod by using the Portal Gun to precipitate one \r<br />or two more falls to clear the &#34;floating walk&#34; state. Sometimes menu or \r<br />area transitions or ground cover also resolves this issue.\r<br />\r<br />[i]Controls[/i]\r<br />\r<br />You switch portal types by equipping and reequipping the gun. This is \r<br />admittedly inconvenient: if there was a sensible way in native scripting\r<br /> to capture melee attacks or capture other keystrokes this would have \r<br />been ideal. It may be more convenient for the moment to assign the gun \r<br />and another weapon to quick keys to accelerate this process.\r<br />\r<br />I have looked into multiple ways of doing this. If you come up with something\r<br />particularly crafty, let me know. Otherwise, I plan to put a version of this out\r<br />for the Script Extender at some point, which should make this more convenient.\r<br />\r<br />And yes, something like ammo-type switch (a player-initiated event tied to the gun,\r<br /> but triggered before the weapon firing) would have been \r<br />quite nice&#33; A way to capture a weapon bash event, as pointed out below, \r<br />would also work.  It turns out that swapping an object/weapon mod on a \r<br />gun requires an unequip-reequip cycle anyway. It&#39;s nice, for example, \r<br />that you can detect if the player is sneaking slightly after the portal \r<br />is opened, but this doesn&#39;t let you perform an action upon the player \r<br />sneaking. There are a handful of other approaches, with their own \r<br />issues. It would do good things for weapon mods not requiring script extenders \r<br />if Bethesda patched an alternate fire mode switching mechanism in at \r<br />some point.\r<br />\r<br />[i]Assets: Nostalgia Deficiency&#33;[/i]\r<br />\r<br />Now, to address the elephant in the room, if anyone does come up with a nice, \r<br />well-rigged, nicely textured mesh to approximate the original gun \r<br />from Portal, I would be happy to help realize a version of this mod \r<br />which uses the attractive and nostalgic assets. I don&#39;t have the expertise or the proper\r<br />tools for the time being to give you all the best run at this, so veteran weapon mesh artists, animators, and NIF configurers\r<br />may be interested in bringing the Portal gun and the authentic portal effects to life.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Community Videos[/b]\r<br />\r<br />A good feature overview comes from user &#34;[url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW6yg9hSuAVZMeT_kMMFxwg]Total SideQuest[/url]&#34;\r<br />[youtube]1W9tSrP9J-Y[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />And if you want visual guidance, there&#39;s this from [url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX86tbjTYYFne8z1XnbD2ug]EpicCRAZY WOLF[/url]: \r<br />[youtube]q23n4LjAVTc[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />Thanks to everyone who makes videos with these mods.\r<br />\r<br />And, finally, hope you all have fun with this.",

                "description": "[size=5][b]Summary[/b][/size]\n<br />\n<br />This mod attempts to vary the distribution of Power Armors throughout the game, as Bethesda has, once again, made one type of armor appear almost exclusively throughout the game, and it makes even less sense this time than it did in Fallout 3.\n<br />\n<br />This adjusts the leveled lists for all types of BOS, Atom Cats, and Military Power armor, which previously only existed for T-60, to use all 4 types of power armor (T-45, T-51, T-60, &amp; X-01). This means that every single member of the Brotherhood (except [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjPau5QYtYs]Paladin Safety Danse if we want to[/url]) and Atom Cats can spawn with any type of level appropriate power armor (and [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjPau5QYtYs]leave our friends behind[/url]) (except Raider).\n<br />\n<br />Thanks to [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/11234/?]Consistent Power Armor Overhaul[/url] (which is [b][u]required[/u][/b]), we have gorgeous paints for the non-T-60 armors, that mesh in perfectly with the default paints, for both the BOS and Atom Cats.\n<br />\n<br />I had to edit the T-45, T-51, and X-01 Power Armors in order to get them to apply the paints when added to the leveled lists. This means incompatibility with any other mods that edit the armor base forms. I have provided a patch for [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/7584/?]Impervious Power Armour[/url], as I personally use it. There aren't very many mods that conflict at the moment, so you should be pretty safe.\n<br />\n<br />They should spawn with armor of the correct rank as well. Knight-Captains will have armor painted for the rank and so on. Due to some serious fucking stupidity and laziness by Bethsoft, the random leveled grunts will not use ranked armor, and will just use knight painted armor. This isn't currently fixable, but I will do my best to fix it once the GECK descends to us mere mortals. Named NPC's should all use correctly painted armor though, so there's that.\n<br />\n<br />I have spent a good deal of time, trying to integrate this in the most compatible, and most seamless manner possible, I think I have gotten it working the best it can at the moment (due to the lack of GECK).\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][b]Features[/b][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Randomized Power Armor for all major factions, no more T-60 exclusivity\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[size=5][b]Requirements &amp; Compatibility[/b][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/11234/?]Consistent Power Armor Overhaul[/url] is awesome and [u]required[/u]\n<br />[*][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/6876/?]Armour Categories Re-done[/url] has a patch\n<br />[*][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/7584/?]Impervious Power Armour[/url] has a patch\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[size=5][b]Recommended Mods[/b][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]You might want to consider using [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/11978/?]Brotherhood Power Armor Overhaul[/url] instead\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[size=5][b]Other Links[/b][/size]\n<br />\n<br />If you would like to know what else I am working on, you can follow me on my [url=http://twitter.com/darthbdaman]Twitter[/url].

They shouldn't die as easily as other NPCs &amp; creatures. [/b][/size]\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[b]I found that after play-testing the mod for weeks i can't play the game anymore without my changes. I hope it makes your gameplay experience better too. In general, it will make the game harder, but it will also train you to become better. [/b][b]Gameplay won't feel as complete without some of the mods recommended above ([b]best you have them all though for the ultimate immersive gameplay possible). [/b][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][b]\n<br />[img]http://i63.tinypic.com/ab3vck.jpg[/img][/b]\n<br />\n<br />What i basically wanted to establish in the mod, is for me (the player) to not have to think each time how the game actors would respond to my actions. For example in real life you know that when you stand 30 meters away from someone at line of sight he will see you. In the game that's not the case. He may, or he may not, you must make guesses. \n<br />\n<br />IRL if you (were to) break into someone's house at night will you start lighting candles in order to see more clearly and navigate through the house? Will you start moving faster just to get on with your daily (/nightly) business? The game doesn't care very much about that. Same goes for absolute darkness - if you are spotted. \n<br />\n<br />My goal was to not have to think how the game would act in a specific scenario. For example when infiltrating a raider base / camp. I would just have to act how i would in real life, ie. be absolutely prepared and ready not to make any mistakes. Which means any noise, running, line of sight with enemy will make you spotted. You will have to be [/b][b][size=3]extra[/size] [/b][b]careful. If you are spotted, you will no longer become \"unspotted\" after a few seconds of searching by the enemies! The enemy AI will be [size=3][u]relentless[/u] [/size]especially on this. The enemy doesn't have schizophrenia. He knows what he saw, he knows what he heard. He saw you! It's a matter of life and death. The NPC's life depends on finding you and killing you! He won't stop searching for you for a long time and in longer distances! [A[b]bout 5 times more searching time actually and x1.5 greater distance radius (careful not to up this too much, as it can cause bugs). Game separates searching time in \"look\" time, as just looking or being suspicious, and in time after you have already been spotted (in which case searching time is much more than \"look\" time.] [/b]The slightest thing can trigger the ai! So do you understand? You don't have to think how the enemies / game ai would react, you act based on intuition (in other words by real life experience to put it semi-loosely). You simply act (more like) the way you would in real life. \n<br />[b]\n<br />All these factors and much more (see technical section) can be adjusted by properly setting various formula coefficients that affect the gameplay. Bethesda set them loosely, because the average gamer doesn't notice and thus may not care about that sort of thing. This mod makes these coefficients more harsh by performing the delicate and intricate process of [u]optimization[/u]. \n<br />\n<br />As i said, the goal is realism. I believe the mod makes the game more realistic (by making it harder). \n<br />[/b]But make sure you also have (at the very least) a greater damage mod in order for all of this to make sense. Even if you the perfect ai mod, what does it matter if the enemies can't kill you? No tactical skills and no challenge and no reward. \n<br />[/b][b]\n<br />The process of optimizing these settings is ongoing (but currently on a stable and sufficient for me level). These tweaks may be improved in a future version, or even more game settings may be considered and come into play. They are, by no means, perfect. I just believe they are better than Vanilla. \n<br />[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[img]http://i67.tinypic.com/1585dz8.jpg[/img]\n<br />\n<br />[b]Of course Bethesda for Fallout is always the first to give thanks for creating the game! [/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b]Various fora, especially on Nexus &amp; Bethesda helped me a great deal in assembling this information. [/b]\n<br />[b]Particularly the websites below: [/b]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][b][size=2][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/74355/?]Skyrim Realistic AI Detection[/url] - Olivier Doorenbos's mod for Skyrim helped me greatly in assembling a lot of information about the game settings and get on with this process faster.

Basically standard, all the penalties lifted.\n<br />3.) Like above, but increased stealth in dark areas.\n<br />4.) Somewhat better-materials via cleaning resulting in more damage.\n<br />5.) Quality materials further increases damage at the cost of more weight, and potentially more AP consumption. It's good for Non-VATS builds.\n<br />6.) High-Quality is an end-game materials, further increases damage at the cost of weight.\n<br />7.) Same as above but with a bit more weight and increased Stealth in dark areas.\n<br />8.) Very light-weight materials resulting in less AP consumption and better handling traits, at the cost of increased recoil.\n<br />9.) Cross-road between High-Quality and Aluminium, Alloyed materials give a bit nice handling traits yet give good damage bonus.\n<br />\n<br />Credits:\n<br /> - AlexSlesh - [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/3181/?]More Realistic Handmade Pipe Weapons[/url]\n<br /> - Johnsack2001 - [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/748/?]Darker pipe weapons[/url]\n<br /> - Billyro - [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/8141/?]Better Reflective Pipe Weapons[/url] \n<br /> - Acacyn - [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/742/?]Darker Pipe Rifle - Pistol - Revolver[/url]\n<br /> - murdalizer - [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/822/?]Brown to Gray Pipe Weapons[/url] \n<br /> - TrickyVein - [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/10484/?]Crossbows of the Commonwealth\n<br />\n<br />Modding Notes:\n<br /> - The actual textures and materials are separated at \"PWO ...\" so to not conflict with vanilla textures.

                "description": "[size=2]Next Version\n<br /> - Option to auto loot food and drink items.\n<br /> - Option for keeping highlights more persistent.\n<br /> - Experimental pulsing highlights.\n<br /> - System for simple compatibility patches.\n<br /> - Detect mines and some types of traps.\n<br />\n<br />Version 3800 - 6/7/2018\n<br /> - Autoloot should properly trigger OnActivation events.\n<br /> - Improved mod startup/reboot time.\n<br />\n<br />[b]DESCRIPTION[/b]\n<br />This mod will highlight corpses, ash/goo piles, unassigned settlers and objects, broken or unpowered objects, friendlies when scoped, creatures sleeping or unconscious, containers, terminals, collectibles, keys, holos, books, plants, doors, weapons, ammo, caps, chems, legendary items.. and even synth infiltrators.  This mod is highly configurable including settings for when and what to highlight, when to unhighlight, and the color of each highlight.\n<br />\n<br />The mod activates once you take the Scrapper perk, or you manually start it via MCM or holotape.\n<br />\n<br />[b]FOR XBOX ONE VERSION [url=https://bethesda.net/en/mods/fallout4/mod-detail/4059313]CLICK HERE[/url][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b]SETTLEMENTS &amp; OWNERSHIP\n<br />[/b]The mod detects when you are in a settlement or an interior location that you own and disables container and item highlights automatically.  No reason to loot something that is already yours.  Out in the world, common loose items will not highlight if taking them would be stealing, but containers will still highlight so that you can examine their contents.\n<br />\n<br />[b]COMPONENT TRACKING[/b]\n<br />In the vanilla game Scrapper rank 2 highlights objects (like junk) that contain components you tag.  You can tag components in the crafting interface and in the pipboy inventory.  This mod provides an alternative to this feature, so you can customize how junk is highlighted.  It also allows you to tag components from the MCM.  If you are not using F4SE customization of this feature is limited.\n<br />\n<br />This feature will highlight objects in the world containing the components you select, and will also include those objects in inventory searches (highlighting corpses and containers).  The mod remembers encountered items and becomes more accurate and responsive over time.\n<br />\n<br />[b]SEMI-AUTOMATIC LOOTING[/b]\n<br />Common sundries such as ammo, chems, caps, bobbypins, as well as tracked junk can be auto-looted.  Junk will be sent to your last visited workshop, while ammo etc. is given to the player when the pipboy is opened.  Non-legendary weapons can be auto-looted and converted immediately to caps.  Quest items are not autolooted and this feature will not take an item if it would count as stealing.  Also survival needs like meats and plants will not be autolooted.\n<br />\n<br />Autolooting is only active while highlights are active.\n<br />\n<br />Normally autoloot triggers on proximity.  But if an exploded corpse is strewn across the battlefield and you can't find the \"center\" of it just pick up a chunk of that supermutant or whatever it used to be and autoloot will trigger.\n<br />\n<br />[b]DYNAMIC MOD WEAPON SUPPORT[/b]\n<br />New weapons and ammo added by mods can be highlighted and autolooted too.  The first time you equip a new weapon from a mod Loot Detector will ask you to confirm adding it to the detection list.  Default ammo for the weapon will automatically be discovered as well.  To teach Loot Detector about special ammo, drop a single round on the ground and let it be highlighted.\n<br />\n<br />[b]SYNTH INFILTRATOR DETECTION[/b]\n<br />Normally when you aim at a friendly they will be highlighted in cyan, but if you have synth highlighting active (and the requisites) synth infiltrators will highlight in gray instead.  When you detect a synth in your settlement, keep your gun trained on them and approach, they will panic and attack (or surrender).  Thus they can be eliminated without turning your settlement against you.\n<br />\n<br />[b]MANUAL OVERRIDE HOTKEY[/b]\n<br />You can map a key via MCM or other means to toggle all active effects.\n<br />Use this console command for manual mapping:\n<br />cqf xatmosScrapperQuest ToggleManualOverride\n<br />\n<br />[b]EXTRA PERK REQUIREMENTS\n<br />[/b](these are disabled by default)\n<br />\n<br />Some features can be gated behind perks as follows:\n<br />- Sleeping highlight requires Mister Sandman.\n<br />- Highlighting unassigned settlers and work objects requires Local Leader.\n<br />- Highlighting scrappable junk requires Scrapper rank 2.\n<br />- Highlighting doors requires VANS.\n<br />- Detecting friendlies requires Awareness.\n<br />- Detecting synth infiltrators requires Awareness AND Robotics Expert.\n<br />- Autolooting items requires Science! AND Scrounger OR Fortune Finder.\n<br />\n<br />[b]UPGRADING &amp; UNINSTALLING\n<br />[/b]Usually uninstalling or upgrading will not cause any problems.  But just to be extra safe, make multiple saves before upgrading or removing the mod.\n<br />\n<br />To fully uninstall, verify that the following files and/or folders are removed:\n<br />Fallout 4&#92;data&#92;scripts&#92;xatmosScrapper*.pex\n<br />Fallout 4&#92;data&#92;scripts&#92;xatmos&#92;xatmosScrapper*.pex\n<br />Fallout 4&#92;data&#92;MCM&#92;Config&#92;Loot Detector&#92;*\n<br />Fallout 4&#92;data&#92;MCM&#92;Config&#92;xatmosLootDetector&#92;*\n<br />Fallout 4&#92;data&#92;textures&#92;effects&#92;gradients&#92;xatmosScrapper&#92;*\n<br />\n<br />[b]INSTALLATION[/b]\n<br />Users of the pre-CK version of this mod should first uninstall everything related to it.  Do not install any \"patches\" for this mod, they are all outdated.\n<br />\n<br />NMM users should download the ESP version.  NMM does not properly support ESL files.  If you are new to modding and run into trouble give [url=http://wiki.tesnexus.com/index.php/Fallout_4_Mod_Installation]this page[/url] a read through!\n<br />\n<br />Don't forget to install the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/16899]Brawl Bug Fix[/url]﻿ by ErshinPL to prevent certain scripted events from breaking.\n<br />\n<br />The mod can take about a minute to boot up for the first time.\n<br />\n<br />[b]CONFIGURATION WITHOUT MCM\n<br />[/b]Check your inventory for the Loot Detector holotape.  Below is a description of each option:\n<br />\n<br />[Features]\n<br />Corpse Vision:  Highlight corpses and ashpiles with loot.\n<br />KO Vision:  Highlight unconscious (e.g drugged, knocked out, or powered down) actors.\n<br />Sandman Vision:  Highlight sleeping friends and foes.\n<br />Loot Vision:  Highlight keys, collectibles, and legendary items in the world (optionally more).\n<br />Dumpster Vision:  Highlight containers with loot.\n<br />Nerd Vision:  Highlight books, holotapes, and terminals.\n<br />Aiming IFF:  Highlight friendlies in ironsights or scoped.\n<br />Explorer Vision:  Highlight doors and door-like objects.\n<br />Taskmaster Vision:  Highlight unassigned settlers and objects, also settlers with quests.\n<br />Mechanist Vision:  Highlight broken and unpowered workshop objects.\n<br />\n<br />[Advanced]\n<br />Common Sundries:  Include ammo, chems, etc in world and inventory scans.\n<br />Survival Needs:  Include food, drink, and flora in scans.\n<br />Weightless Trifles:  Highlight and/or loot 0-weight items with a cap value.\n<br />Legendary Tracker:  Show or hide the tracker quest objective.\n<br />Proximity Suppression:  Suppress highlights on actors when in close proximity.\n<br />Component Highlighting:  Include scrappable junk.\n<br />Disable Vanilla Component Radar:  Prevent vanilla Scrapper2 highlighting.\n<br />Extra Perk Requirements:  Require additional perks for some features.\n<br />Unhighlighting:  Determines behavior for corpses and containers.\n<br />VATS Override:  Set how VATS interacts with highlight conditions..\n<br />Auto Collect:  Toggle auto-looting common sundries and junk.\n<br />Caps4Guns:  Automatically convert plain weapons to caps.\n<br />Voigt-Kampff Protocol:  Determine how to handle synth infiltrators.\n<br />Corpse Context:  Condition for highlighting remains.\n<br />Sandman Context:  Condition for highlighting unconscious actors.\n<br />Loot Context:  Condition for highlighting items and containers.\n<br />Explorer Context:  Condition for highlighting doors and nerd stuff.\n<br />Workshop Context:  Condition for workshop highlights.\n<br />\n<br />Currently there are more options that are only available in the MCM.\n<br />\n<br />[b]COMPATIBILITY[/b]\n<br />- Load order does not matter at all (no vanilla forms are modified).\n<br />- F4SE and MCM are not required, but highly recommended.\n<br />- No DLC is required.  All DLC is supported.\n<br />- The Unofficial Patch is highly recommended.\n<br />- Mods that change the boundaries of settlements could cause problems.\n<br />- Some items from other mods may not be detected within inventories.\n<br />- If junk components are changed, tracking may not be accurate.\n<br />- Only vanilla components (adhesive, steel, etc.) are supported.\n<br />\n<br />[b]KNOWN ISSUES[/b]\n<br />- Doors placed as static objects like rubble or fake walls may be highlighted.\n<br />- Flora that is not harvestable may be highlighted anyway.\n<br />- Shaders do not work on some transparent objects like glass beakers.\n<br />- Magnifying glass icon on tagged objects doesn't update until reload.\n<br />- The friendly highlight can get temporarily stuck if toggled rapidly.\n<br />- Shotgun ammo boxes highlight but do not trigger a proximity event.\n<br />[/size]",

The exception is the Unofficial Patch which should be placed before this in your load order so that the additional script changes made by Workshop Framework will overwrite the UFO4P versions. \n<br />\n<br />[size=4]New in 2020 - Settlement Layout System[/size]\n<br />[center][youtube]N3MGiari9xc[/youtube][/center]\n<br />[center][youtube]9OVzgFzjnRw[/youtube][/center]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]Overall Goal[/size]\n<br />\n<br />The goal of Workshop Framework is to open up the settlement system so we can do more interesting things with it.\n<br />\n<br />Adjusting most of the behavior of settlements requires adjusting the Workshop scripts - and as soon as you do that, you are incompatible with all other mods that want to edit that same script. Since the Settlements are controlled with just a few scripts - many things you may have thought would be simple, basically never got made into mods because people don't want to deal with the hassle of having edited vanilla scripts.\n<br />\n<br />No more! Workshop Framework completely rewrites many of the base workshop scripts and introduces tons of hooks, new options, and eliminates most hard-coded variables so that tons of mod authors can release mods editing just the part of the settlement system they want to change.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]Easy-to-Use Advanced Systems[/size]\n<br />\n<br />On top of opening up the scripts, I've added several advanced systems presented in a simple way, so that even people without a massive programming background can contribute new mods and functionality that add very powerful changes to settlements. For example, much of the code that makes the Sim Settlements City Plan's work is now a core system in Workshop Framework so that anyone with a little bit of coding experience can dynamically place large swathes of objects in a settlement on the fly!\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]Design Philosophy[/size]\n<br />\n<br />When designing this, it was important to me that the core gameplay functionality of settlements is completely unaltered by this framework. If you install this in your game, you should notice no difference other than the few bugs it fixes and an overall performance increase with settlement related activities. All gameplay options are left intact, and always will be.\n<br />\n<br />That said, somethings will work wildly different behind the scenes in order to open new options for adjustment, so while players can safely install this without thinking about it, if you are a mod author - you are likely very concerned about what this is doing! So to alleviate your fears, I offer the following:\n<br />\n<br />- I have not altered any vanilla property or function signatures. If you are currently expecting a function or property from the existing workshop scripts - it's still there, so your code will not break.\n<br />\n<br />- I will never alter property names or function signatures of anything in Workshop Framework now that it is released. Any time I'm forced to adjust a function, I will leave the original version in tact and simply point it to the updated version. This way you can be confident your mods based on WSFW will continue to work from version to version.\n<br />\n<br />- I will do everything in my power to keep this code bug-free, and am open to suggestions and improvements to the code base so that we can all have a flexible, powerful core to work from.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]Documentation[/size]\n<br />\n<br />For complete documentation, head to the [url=https://github.com/kinggath/WorkshopFramework]Github repo[/url].\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]Demo Mod[/size]\n<br />\n<br />The optional file is a demo mod, not meant for widespread usage. It is designed to show the potential of certain parts of the code, and allow people who want to see these features expanded on and improved test them out quickly to help give me feedback and bug reports.\n<br />\n<br />v1.0.0 - All friendly NPCs will have an alternate activation called Recruit. This will allow you to convert virtually any NPC to a settler and send them to one of your settlements. (This is made possible by a code overhaul in version 2.0.0 of Workshop Framework). Note that these NPCs will not work with Sim Settlements plots due to the way plots are coded currently (this will change in some future version of Sim Settlements).\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]Open Source and Permissions\n<br />[/size]\n<br />While this is open-source, and anyone has permission to make use of pieces of code found inside of these scripts, please do not release new versions of the exact same named scripts, or release things based on the code that would interfere with what this mod is trying to achieve. The idea is that this framework will become a central staple we can all build on without compatibility issues.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]The Future[/size]\n<br />\n<br />- Continue Improving the speed and stability of the Workshop scripts.\n<br />- Flesh out and expand the API.\n<br />- Add more hooks to allow doing other things the community dreams up (drop by the Github repo to join in the discussion or even get in on the development!).\n<br />- Add additional advanced systems that more mod authors can take advantage of to add extra functionality to their mods without the need for a programming background.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]Special Thanks[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/users/106891?tab=user+files]1000101[/url] - For helping me develop the threading system and allowing me to use his thread locking code!\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/users/684492]Arthmoor[/url] and the rest of the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/4598]Unofficial Patch team[/url] for allowing me to use their Workshop fixes!\n<br />\n<br />Woodfuzzy, Krazyhorse, and Moonbeam for testing the crap out of this so I could feel comfortable releasing it...",

The function in question is ﻿[code]GetPrivateProfileString[/code], a relic of 16 bit operating systems. But do you know what is worse than using such a function? Using it hundreds of thousands of times.Apparently the game uses that function for every game setting individually, which means that the same ini file is opened and closed hundreds of times. What really makes this terrible is the fact that for each enabled plugin the game will attempt to read all the same settings from a hypothetical INI file that that plugin might or might not be loading. So you end up with an insane amount of incredibly inefficient calls for each enabled mod plugin. As a solution this mod will hook the functions involved and load the target INI files in memory so that each following call to the same INI file will be much faster as it will read directly from memory and will not require opening the file from scratch again.\n<br />\n<br />The amount of seconds that this mod will reduce your start time by depends on the amount of enabled plugins you have, as well as other things using INI files such as ENB (though ENB comes with it's own loading issues that this mod can't fix). It will be basically imperceptible when used on the vanilla game and will go up from there, shaving off 6 seconds for 50 or so plugins, up to 20+ seconds for 250+ plugins.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Solution[/b]\n<br />When the game, ENB or something else calls [code]GetPrivateProfileString[/code] first time this plugin will load requested file in memory and return required data. Next time, no file will be loaded and data will be fetched from memory as well. Same thing happens when process tries to write a value to file. Instead of opening file again, parse and save to disk the plugin will write data it to in-memory file and then saves to disk (if allowed). Also all files is saved on game close, if game won't crash in process.\n<br />\n<br />Plugin source is available on [url=https://github.com/KerberX/PrivateProfileRedirector]GitHub[/url].\n<br />\n<br />[s]Some problems such as infinite loading screen and weird camera FOV were reported. You have been warned.[/s] Should have been fixed in version 0.3.1.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Requirements[/b]\n<br />F4SE, [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/33946]xSE PluginPreloader F4[/url].\n<br />\n<br />[b]Installation[/b]\n<br />It's an F4SE plugin, so install like any other F4SE plugin.

Slightly slower performance if enabled.\n<br />With this enabled the ini files are sure to be saved even in case the game crashes for some reason.\n<br />Enabled by default.\n<br />[b]SaveOnWrite=1[/b]\n<br />\n<br />When 'SaveOnWrite' is enabled, this option sets maximum number of changes per file before they will be saved to disk.\n<br />For example, 'SaveOnWriteBuffer' is set to '3'. The game made two changes, they are saved in memory but not yet\n<br />saved to disk. The game changes another option and now this INI file will be saved to disk with all three changes.\n<br />Counter resets for this file and after another 3 changes it'll be saved again.\n<br />Disabled by default (0). Possible values: [2, 2000]. If the value is outside of this range the option is considered disabled.\n<br />[b]SaveOnWriteBuffer=0[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Saves all cached files to disk each time a game thread exits.\n<br />With this enabled the ini files will be saved periodically and will probably be saved in case the game crashes for some reason.\n<br />Disabled by default.\n<br />[b]SaveOnThreadDetach=0[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Saves all cached files to disk on DLL unload (usually on this happens when the game exits).\n<br />Enabled by default.\n<br />[b]SaveOnProcessDetach=1[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Saves all cached files to disk before saving the game.\n<br />Enabled by default.\n<br />[b]SaveOnGameSave=1\n<br />[/b]\n<br />Enables support for inline comments for values.\n<br />If enabled these comments will not be preserved, but value will be correctly read.\n<br />Otherwise comments will be read as part of value.\n<br />Enabled by default.\n<br />\n<br />[Section]\n<br />Key1=0x11 #comment1\n<br />Key2=0x1E ;comment2\n<br />[b]ProcessInlineComments=1[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Set code-page to convert non-ASCII characters.\n<br />Set to CP_UTF8 to use v0.1.x behavior (not recommended).\n<br />If you're on Japanese Windows version you might need to use CP_UTF8.\n<br />See full list here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/intl/code-page-identifiers\n<br />CP_ACP by default.\n<br />\n<br />CP_ACP                         0           Default to ANSI code page\n<br />CP_OEMCP                   1           Default to OEM code page\n<br />CP_MACCP                   2           Default to MAC code page\n<br />CP_THREAD_ACP        3           Current thread's ANSI code page\n<br />CP_SYMBOL                 42          SYMBOL translations\n<br />CP_UTF7                       65000       UTF-7 translation\n<br />CP_UTF8                       65001       UTF-8 translation\n<br />[b]ANSICodePage=0[/b]\n<br />[/spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />[b]Q&amp;A[/b]\n<br />[b]Q:[/b] Do I really need this?\n<br />[b]A:[/b] It depends. If your game starts from shortcut to main menu in split second then no. If it takes longer, this plugin can help. How much time you will save depends on your setup.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Q:[/b] Will this work with MO/NMM/Vortex/Kortex (yeah, I had to mention it) or any other mod manager?\n<br />[b]A:[/b] It was tested with MO2, Vortex and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/90868]Kortex[/url] and no problems was found. NMM have not been tested yet but are expected to work just fine. I can't say anything about compatibility with other mod managers.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Q:[/b] I've installed it and game crashes at startup (or you have any other problem).\n<br />[b]A:[/b] Enable log in config file and reproduce your crash. Go to [code]Data&#92;F4SE&#92;Plugins[/code], look for file [code]PrivateProfileRedirector.log[/code], zip it, upload it somewhere and post a link to it in your issue report. Log file can be more that 100 MB, so don't upload it as is, be sure to compress it.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Q:[/b] There is new version of Fallout 4 and/or F4SE, can I use this version with new game/F4SE version?\n<br />[b]A:[/b] Redirector itself doesn't need Script Extender to function. The only thing that depends on F4SE is overriding of \"RefreshINI\" console command to reload files from disk to update cached INI files. If you load Redirector without F4SE or with newer or older version of F4SE the Redirector will not override \"RefreshINI\" but still will function as usual. So [b]you can use this plugin with any game and F4SE version[/b].\n<br />\n<br />If you absolutely need \"RefreshINI\" command to work with this plugin and I haven't had time to update it, you can disable Script Extender version check in [code]PrivateProfileRedirector.ini[/code] file. Open it, find option [code]AllowSEVersionMismatch[/code] and change its value to [code]1[/code].\n<br />\n<br />Thanks to everyone who helped test the plugin, especially AL12 and Augh.",

                "description": "[size=6][color=#f1c232]Faster Workshop[/color][/size]\n<br />\n<br />Faster Workshop is an F4SE plugin that optimizes workshop loading times by replacing some of the most expensive and inefficient regions of workshop loading code with far more efficient versions.\n<br />\n<br />On top of this, it also does two more things:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Provides a hotkey to instantly enter Workshop mode.\n<br />[*]Fixes the issue with workshop icons not loading when navigating through them quickly.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />Testers with a current workshop load time of ~15s (from activating a Workshop to having the build menu appear) report a drop in load time to less than half a second. Those with a lower starting load time report near-instantaneous Workshop loads with the plugin installed.\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][color=#f1c232]About[/color][/size]\n<br />\n<br />As you acquire more mods that add content to your game, you may have noticed the game freezing up (video freezes and you cannot move) for increasingly longer periods of time when you attempt to start Workshop mode. Even when these mods have nothing to do with the Workshop!\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][i]What's going on?[/i][/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[spoiler]It boils down to the game using some incredibly inefficient code to figure out what objects you can build in workshop mode. Whenever you start Workshop mode, the game evaluates the conditions on [b]every single constructible object in the game[/b] to find out if they belong in the workshop - this includes even non-workshop items like weapon mods and chems. And it does that not just once (!), but repeats this loop for [b]each and every workshop submenu you have[/b]!\n<br />\n<br />If you install a mod that adds two new submenus to your workshop, one would reasonably expect to incur just a small overhead of a couple of additional checks. Instead, in reality, this causes two more loops through every single craftable object in the game.\n<br />\n<br />As you install more mods that add any kind of craftable object to the game, entering the workshop will inevitably and perhaps noticeably slow down, even if these objects have nothing to do with the workshop.\n<br />\n<br />And to make it all worse, every time you exit the workshop, the game tears down all this data it worked so hard to build and starts over![/spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][color=#f1c232]Do I need this mod?[/color][/size]\n<br />\n<br />When you start workshop mode, is there any noticeable delay before the build menu appears? If so, this mod can help.\n<br />\n<br />If you do not currently experience any lag when starting Workshop mode, congratulations! You have a beefy-enough rig, or do not have many (workshop) mods installed. But do keep this mod in mind in case you need it in the future. The rate of load time increase is [b]not linear[/b] in the number of mods you have installed - it is far worse, so you may see load times shoot up quickly if you install certain kinds of mods. (see About section for more detailed information)\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][color=#f1c232]How it works (technical)[/color][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[spoiler]This F4SE plugin rewrites code that handles workshop object loading. On the first workshop load of the game session, the plugin goes through the constructible objects once and maps keywords to their constructible objects. Now, instead of looping through the entire COBJ list every time a mapping of COBJ to KWYD is needed, it is a constant-time operation to look up this information from the prebuilt map. Conditions will now only be evaluated on COBJs that belong in the workshop category, instead of all loaded COBJs.[/spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][color=#f1c232]Installation[/color][/size]\n<br />\n<br />Install with your preferred mod manager, or copy the files in the download to your Fallout 4 Data folder.\n<br />Make sure that you start the game with the F4SE loader, otherwise F4SE will not be active.\n<br />\n<br />This is an in-memory code patch. It does not attach any scripts to objects or your save and is safe to install or remove at any time.\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][color=#f1c232]Requirements[/color][/size]\n<br />\n<br />Fallout 4 game version 1.10.50 or higher.\n<br />[url=http://f4se.silverlock.org/]Fallout 4 Script Extender (F4SE)[/url], 0.6.4 or higher.\n<br />The [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/21497/]Mod Configuration Menu[/url], if you want to assign a hotkey for starting Workshop mode.

At all.\r<br />\r<br />What this means for players is if you want to build a cool robot, you HAVE to invest in crafting skills, some of which has steep requirements.\r<br />What this means for a player going through the game with no crafting skills at all (and therefore needs to 1: scavenge weapon and armor mods or 2: spend caps at vendors to get decent guns and armor) can&#39;t build any cool robots. At all.\r<br />\r<br />Ball bearings to that.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />- Vanilla robots now drop appropriate robot parts (limbs, weapons, armor).\r<br />- Mechanist robots now drop a large selection of parts, with a slight bias towards ranged weapons. May also drop hydraulic or voltaic frames.\r<br />- Regular Robobrains now have their own leveled list, but robobrains with prefixes (integrated etc) will drop the same variety of parts as other mechanist robots, but with a bias towards robobrain parts.\r<br />- Rust Devil robots now drop a large selection of parts, with a slight bias towards melee weapons. May also drop appropriate armor (warmonger, serrated etc).\r<br />- One merchant may now sell robot parts. The merchant will become available upon completing the Automatron &#39;good&#39; ending.\r<br />\r<br />Specific drop chances are available in the ReadMe.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Compatability:\r<br />Anything that changes death item leveled lists for vanilla robots will create a conflict.\r<br />Anything that changes Automatron exclusive robot NPCs or death item leveled lists will create a conflict.",

Attach an Axe Stock or Spiked Grip, play it like a combination melee and ranged weapon. Do you fancy a Strength Build? The Heavy Barrel turns pipe-weapons into a Heavy-Gun!\n<br />\n<br />If you liked this mod, please endorse, and check out my other mods. ^_^\n<br />\n<br />Be sure to check out the links below first if you're interested in optimizing the Pipe Weapons as a whole, or simply do not know how to properly install a mod yet.[/quote]\n<br />CREDITS:\n<br />\n<br /> - Bethesda - Fallout 4 (And fcking some things up that we have to make mod to make it better)\n<br /> - opengts – Large Drum Magazine Model\n<br /> - Kashrlyyk and Elgoes – all other models \n<br /> - LinuX123 - Gunner Sight model\n<br /> - Kriskos - FOMOD Template (I suck at this fomod thing)\n<br /> - Sean_s - Flashlight Model\n<br /> - TrickyVein - Crossbow Spiked Stirrup + Long Barrels\n<br /> - henkspamadres - Deathclaw Bayonet\n<br /> - JKruse05 - Pipe Revolver\n<br /> - Veratai - Axe Stock\n<br />\n<br />Useful Links:\n<br />\n<br /> - [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/4809/?]Pipe Weapons Mag-In Sound Fix[/url]\n<br /> - [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/8666/?]Moddable Pipe Weapon Materials[/url] (Retexture Set)\n<br /> - [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/9476/?]See-Through Combat Scopes - 4x Magnification[/url]\n<br /> - [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/5406/?]Legendary Modification Rebalance[/url]\n<br /> - [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/4042/?]Craftable Legendary Mods[/url]\n<br /> - [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/41236]Strength-Based Bash-Bonus[/url]\n<br />\n<br />My Weapon Overhauls:\n<br />\n<br /> &gt; [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/7556]Pipe Weapons[/url] + [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/8666]Materials[/url]  \n<br /> &gt; [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/4227]Minigun[/url]  \n<br /> &gt; [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/4711]Laser Musket[/url]  \n<br /> &gt; [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/6742]Gatling Laser[/url]  \n<br /> &gt; [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/15696]Laser-Plasma[/url]  \n<br /> &gt; [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/15166]Missile Launcher[/url] \n<br /> &gt; [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/40765]SMG[/url]  \n<br /> &gt; [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/41119]Railway[/url]  \n<br /> &gt; [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/41160]Hunting Rifle[/url]  \n<br /> &gt; [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/41231]Combat Weapons[/url] \n<br /> &gt; [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/41269]Assault Rifle[/url]  \n<br /> &gt; [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/41303]Lever Rifle[/url] \n<br /> &gt; [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/41304]Radium Rifle[/url] \n<br /> &gt; [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/41326]Handmade Rifle[/url] \n<br /> &gt; [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/41315]Sidearms[/url]\n<br /> &gt; [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/41297]Double-Barrel[/url] \n<br /> &gt; [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/41420]Flamer[/url] \n<br /> &gt; [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/41497]Fatman[/url]\n<br /> &gt; [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/41344]All-In-One Merged Pack[/url]\n<br />\n<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<br />\n<br /> - [url=https://wiki.tesnexus.com/index.php/Fallout_4_Mod_Installation]How to install mods[/url]\n<br /> - [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZpIQ6P38xE]How to install mods manually demo[/url]\n<br /> - [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAKcAEn6hLg]How to install mods using NMM demo[/url]\n<br />\n<br />Main Changes:\n<br />\n<br />1.)

There's also explosive slug with slower projectile speed but deals AOE damage, and Incendiary that bathes an area with a cloud of fire. \n<br />\n<br />3.) Added and Changed Things\n<br />\n<br /> - Certain NPCs are tougher, such as Diamond Security, and Lucy Abernathy.\n<br /> - Did you ever notice how the glow of the Glow-Sights seems to tarnish?

It no longer weakens anymore.\n<br /> - Added Large Suppressors and rebalanced Suppressors.\n<br /> - Rebalanced Recoil of Pipe Weapon Attachments\n<br /> - Separated Bayonets from the Muzzle, simplifying the combination. Now Added underbarrel slot, with the Bayonets and flashlight.\n<br /> - Long-Barrels to \"Carbine Barrels\", and new Long Barrels with more range. Recalibrated Barrels' bonuses, with lesser AP penalties and redistributed recoil and ADS spread. Finned series has the least Hip-Fire spread penalty of the length.\n<br /> - Added Large Drum Magazine for the Pipe-Gun, sporting 120 capacity, and even lesser handling qualities.\n<br /> - Added Small Magazines for the Pipe Gun, sporting only 10 Capacity, but improved handling traits.\n<br /> - Added \"Night Recon\" Scope series, Combined Recon + Night Vision.\n<br /> - Added “Heavy” barrels: provides the most accuracy, range, and recoil-reduction in their Length.

Chokes are tapering of the barrel by the muzzle, that which tightens the spread.\n<br /> - Choke, Half Choke, and Full Choke tightens spread, and improves range by 10/20/30% at the cost of more recoil.\n<br /> - Rebalanced Incendiary Legendary to do 28 damage over 6s, that stacks.\n<br /> - Fixed Drum-Mag Brackets. If you don't know, originally, it moves with the magazine, and now it doesn't.\n<br /> - Added Spiked Sharpshooter's Grip and Axe Stock, requiring Gun-Nut 2, and Blacksmith 1. Deals heavy bash damage, but does not stack with Bayonets.\n<br />\n<br />4.)

The NPCs that wielded them, except Amelia, has increased Health, Energy, and Aggression. \n<br />\n<br />[quote] - Peacemaker (xx000B36): \"Six rounds, no compromise.

Has \"Violent\" legendary attachment, spawns with Heavy Short Barrel, Glow-Sights, Heavy-Frame,  Sharpshooter's Grip, and pistol caliber; .45-Receiver, .44-Magnum, or .500-Magnum at higher levels.[/quote][quote] - Lady Luck (xx000B37): \"The personification of luck, Lady Luck makes Critical a gamble that you make or break.\"\n<br />\n<br />Pipe Assault-Rifle of [b]Red Tourette,[/b] Designed for heavy-damaging VATs crit, to vomit bullets; using the Long-Burst offered by the Rapid Automatic + 100% Crit bonus of \"Calibrated\" + \"Lucky-Weapon\"' 100% crit-bonus as well, the \"Lady Luck\" packs one hell of a VATs Crit, and you can always pair it with Better Criticals perk. Has \"Lucky Weapon\" legendary attachment, spawns with Heavy Short Barrel, Glow-Sights, Quick-Eject Large-Magazine, Marksman's Stock, Heavy-Frame, Rapid Automatic Trigger, Calibrated, Armor-Piercing, and uses 5mm, 5.56mm, .308, or .30-06. [/quote][quote] - Quickcaster (xx000B42): \"Professionals shoot twice.\"\n<br />\n<br />Pipe Sniper-Rifle of [b]Sully Mathis [/b][Pull the Plug], has \"Vats-Enchanced\" legendary attachment, -40% AP cost version which is not available for guns normally.

Far-Harbor Changes:\n<br />\n<br />  - \"M4-Carbine\" Legendary; December's Child has +35% damage, +35% rate of fire, +25% reload-speed and -50% weight.\n<br />  - Bertha and Tony looks less beggars, with Small Bertha 10% taller, to make her look more a teenager and less of a child.\n<br />  - Bilge uses the legendary weapon: \"Deuce Ex\" Pipe Gun LMG, with Steadfast Legendary. (xx000804) \n<br />  - Malcolm uses the legendary weapon: \"Right-Arm of the Wasteland\" Pipe Battle Rifle, with Retarded Auto, and has Deadeye Legendary. (xx000806)\n<br />  - Braun uses the legendary weapon: \"Russian Roulette\" Pipe Revolver, with Heavy Short Barrel, and Defiant Legendary. (xx000807)\n<br />  - \"Glorious Revolution\" is lootable from Douglas. Pipe Revolver, with Heavy Short Barrel, and Resilient Legendary. (xx000807)\n<br />  - \"Victoria's Secret\" is lootable in Southwest Harbor inside \"Victoria's Trunk\", it is a Pipe Scout-Rifle with stub barrel and suppressor, and has Hitman Legendary. (xx000823)\n<br />\n<br />7.) Nuka-World changes:\n<br />\n<br />  - Added 7.62mm Reciever, deals 29 for Pipe Gun, 37 for Bolt Action, 33 for Revolver with capacity of 8. Has 1.00 Speed.\n<br />  - Handmade Rifle damage from 32, to 40. Full-Auto fire Rate from 1.25 to 1, and more recoil.\n<br />  - Handmade Rifle chamberings 5.56mm, 5mm, and .308.\n<br />  - Handmade Rifle Quick Eject Small Mag to Quick Eject Mag with 20 round capacity.\n<br />  - Rebalanced Handmade Rifle receivers to follow traditional trend; 25% each step.\n<br />\n<br />8.) Optional Tweaks - included is changes to other weapons instead. \n<br />\n<br /> - Rechambered Deliverer to .38, reduced damage to 16.\n<br />\n<br /> - Double Barrel Shotgun deals 70 damage, from 45. Stagger Increased to Extra Large. Deals 100% damage bonus at point-blank range.\n<br /> - Combat Shotgun' Stagger increased to Large. Deals 100% damage bonus at point-blank range.\n<br />  - Double-Barrel Shotgun has \"Double Fire\" feature which uses Twin Shotgun-Shells (custom ammo craftable at Chemistry Workbench), has double everything.\n<br />  - Chokes are integrated with Double-Barrel and Combat Shotgun.\n<br />  - .44-Magnum has Trigger mod \"Fanned Trigger\"\n<br />  - Mini Nuke, and Nuke Mines can incinerate, like Laser Gun.\n<br />  - Mr. Gutsy uses 5.56mm.\n<br />  - Sentry Bots uses .50 Cal and increased damage to 36, and speed to 12.7 -- the same speed as SMGs.\n<br />  - Legendary Mods: Powerful to +35%, Violent to +50% damage and limb damage. Powerful, Violent, and Two-Shot now has Multiplicative than Additive Damage.\n<br />\n<br />Notes:\n<br />  - The Heavy Barrel and Shotgun Grenade rounds turn the weapon into a Heavy Gun that is improved by the Heavy Gunner perk. This ties in with the melee-attachments, allowing a strength-based build.\n<br />  - Nick Valentine’s Revolver comes with attachments. Using the console command, use \"00002f25.removeitem 5bba7; 00002f25.additem 5bba7\" (without the quotes) to reset his default weapon.\n<br />  - The Legendary Weapons may fail to spawn if you have already encountered the NPCs that wielded them or containers that have them.\n<br />  - This mod cuts both ways, making the wielder of the weapons a bit more powerful, as such in the enemies' hands it will be equally painful to deal with.\n<br />  - This mod conflicts with any mod that modifies any Object Modification entities, as such it's not compatible with the Better Mod Descriptions, any mod that modifies the Player NPC directly, as well as anything that adds new Receivers for any of the three pipe weapons. Since the mod borrows sound from something like .44 Pistol, should the sound used by the .44 Pistol is changed, this weapon’s .44 Pistol sound will also change. This also applies to all calibers and to automatic and suppressed fire modes too.\n<br />  - The naming mechanism conflicts with any mods that modify it, such as Valdacil's Better Item-Sorting Mod. While it works, it just doesn't apply to the three weapons as they use a different INNR record. There is a compatibility patch for that -- not that it uses Valdacil's but it's made to somewhat fit.\n<br />  - I also tweaked the Loading Screen.\n<br />  -  The sound change uses the default sounds of other weapons via keywords. If you change sounds of any of the default weapon, this means the used sound of this weapons will change too. E.g. if you changed the 10mm Pistol's sound, the 10mm Receiver also changes sound.\n<br />\n<br />[quote] - Currently, the Pipe Revolver has [color=gold][b]hundreds of millions[/b][/color] of possible combinations:  \n<br />\n<br />  &gt; Basic: = 9 (Receiver) x 13 (Barrels) x 8 (Stocks/Grips) x 4 (damage mod) x 2 (trigger mod) x 3 (frame mod) x 2 (calibration) x 6 (ammo mod) x 23 (Sights/Scopes) = 6200064 (10,055,232 with DLC)\n<br />  &gt; Bayonet is not allowed with suppressors, = 6 (Underbarrel) x 5 (Muzzles) = 30, subtract suppressor-bayonet combination = 26 x 6200064 = 161,201,664 (261,436,032 with DLC)\n<br />  &gt; Heavy Barrels can only put flashlights: 3 x 8 x 9 x 4 x 2 x 3 x 2 x 6 x 23 x 3 = 4,292,352 (5,246,208 with DLC)\n<br />  &gt; Shotgun = 13 x 8 x 4 x 2 x 3 x 2 x 3 (Ammo type excluding Explosive Slugs) x 23 x 26 x 4 (Chokes) = 35,822,592\n<br />  &gt; Heavy Barrel Shotgun: 8 x 4 x 2 x 3 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 23 x 6 x 4 = 2,543,616\n<br />  &gt; Slug Shotgun (No Snub): 3 (Barrels) x 8 x 4 x 2 x 3 x 2 x 2 (Two Ammo types) x 23 x 4 x 6 = 423,936\n<br />  &gt; Snub Slug Shotgun (No suppressed): 3 (Muzzles) x 8 x 4 x 2 x 3 x 2 x 2 (Two Ammo types) x 23 x 4 x 6 (Underbarrels) = 1,271,808\n<br />  &gt; Snub Slug Shotgun (suppressed): 2 (Muzzles) x 8 x 4 x 2 x 3 x 2 x 2 (Two Ammo types) x 23 x 4 x 4 (underbarrel w/o Bayonets) = 565,248\n<br />\n<br />161,201,664 + 4,292,352 + 35,822,592 + 2,543,616 + 423,936 + 1,271,808 + 565,248 = [color=gold][b][size=4]206,121,216[/size][/b][/color][/quote][quote] - Currently, the Pipe Bolt Action has [color=gold][b]hundreds of millions[/b][/color] of possible combinations:  \n<br />\n<br />  &gt; Basic: = 6 (Receiver) x 13 (Barrels) x 8 (Stocks/Grips) x 4 (damage mod) x 2 (trigger mod) x 3 (frame mod) x 2 (calibration) x 6 (ammo mod) x 23 (Sights/Scopes) = 4,133,376\n<br />  &gt; Bayonet is not allowed with suppressors, = 6 (Underbarrel) x 5 (Muzzles) = 30, subtract suppressor-bayonet combination = 26 x 4,133,376 = 10,7467,776\n<br />  &gt; Heavy Barrels can only put flashlights: 3 x 8 x 6 x 4 x 2 x 3 x 2 x 6 x 23 x 3 = 2,861,568\n<br />  &gt; Shotgun = 13 x 8 x 4 x 2 x 3 x 2 x 3 (Ammo type excluding Explosive Slugs) x 23 x 26 x 4 (Chokes) = 35,822,592\n<br />  &gt; Heavy Barrel Shotgun: 8 x 4 x 2 x 3 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 23 x 6 x 4 = 2,543,616\n<br />  &gt; Slug Shotgun (No Snub): 3 (Barrels) x 8 x 4 x 2 x 3 x 2 x 2 (Two Ammo types) x 23 x 4 x 6 = 423,936\n<br />  &gt; Snub Slug Shotgun (No suppressed): 3 (Muzzles) x 8 x 4 x 2 x 3 x 2 x 2 (Two Ammo types) x 23 x 4 x 6 (Underbarrels) = 1,271,808\n<br />  &gt; Snub Slug Shotgun (suppressed): 2 (Muzzles) x 8 x 4 x 2 x 3 x 2 x 2 (Two Ammo types) x 23 x 4 x 4 (underbarrel w/o Bayonets) = 565,248\n<br />\n<br />10,7467,776 + 2,861,568 + 35,822,592 + 2,543,616 + 423,936 + 1,271,808 + 565,248 = [color=gold][b][size=4]150,956,544[/size][/b][/color][/quote][quote] - Currently, the Pipe Gun has [color=gold][b]BILLIONS[/b][/color] of possible combinations: \n<br />\n<br />  &gt; Basic: 9 (Receiver) x 13 (Barrels) x 8 (Stocks/Grips) x 10 (Magazines) x 4 (damage mod) x 6 (trigger mod) x 3 (frame mod) x 2 (calibration) x 6 (Ammo Mod) x 23 (Sights/Scopes)  = 186,001,920\n<br />  &gt; Bayonet is not allowed with suppressors, = 6 (Underbarrel) x 5 (Muzzles) = 30, subtract suppressor-bayonet combination = 26 x 186,001,920 = 4,836,049,920\n<br />  &gt; Heavy Barrel can only use flashlights: 9 x 3 x 8  x 4 x 6 x 3 x 2 x 6 x 23 x 3 = 12,877,056\n<br />\n<br />4,836,049,920 +  12,877,056 = [color=gold][b][size=4]4,848,926,976.[/size][/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Lots of different possible combinations, lol.

                "description": "[color=#93c47d][u][b]DESCRIPTION[/b][/u][/color]\r<br />[b]\r<br />Update v2.0 (06.04.2016): I love it when a plan comes together. Or when two mods come together. Better Weapon Mod Descriptions has merged with [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/5028/]Better Armor Mod Descriptions[/url] into this mod: Better Mod Descriptions, combining both mods into a single one. No more having to use both BAMD and BWMD just to get your numbers fix for Legendary Modifications, it&#39;s all in one place now.\r<br />Update v2.1 (27.05.2016): Reaching even the Farthest Harbor, the newest DLC&#39;s armor and weapon mods are now included in this update.\r<br />\r<br />And a bonus for NMM users: There is now a All-In-One NMM file which allows you to install any and all mods from a single download. Because I can. Note that just because you can choose every single compatible file doesn&#39;t necessarily mean they&#39;re all inter-compatible.\r<br />\r<br />A further note: There&#39;s a known bug in Fallout 4 which can cause the game to crash when attempting to load a save file which is missing 4+ plugins. If this happens, you can circumvent this issue by forcibly loading the save file via console commands, use [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/838/]F4SGE[/url] to clear your save file of any references to missing plugins or simply rename new plugins to their old names until the bug doesn&#39;t trigger.\r<br />\r<br />Compatibility versions only modify the descriptions of modifications that are actually changed by the to-be compatible mod. You need the main BMD file as well as the compatible version. Load Order should be: Main BMD File followed by Other Mod followed by Other Mod Compatible BMD File.[/b]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b]Additionally, a Google Spreadsheet with all vanilla base & Automatron weapons and their respective modifications as well as \r<br />legendary effects can be found under the articles tab.[/b]\r<br />\r<br />Tired of Better Recoil, Exceptional Damage or Poor Range? Want to know how much a Dense Chestpiece actually reduces explosive damage? Try some actual numbers on your mods&#33;\r<br />\r<br />Better Mod Descriptions strives to give you some actual information on what each armor and weapon mod does by changing the descriptions of each and every modification.\r<br />\r<br />It leaves all values at their vanilla setting and merely lists them all - including some which weren&#39;t actually noted in the old descriptions but still present. Using BMD does not make your weapon mods stronger or weaker in any way.\r<br />\r<br />So, what does Better Weapon Mod Descriptions do exactly? Here&#39;s an example, using the Hunting Rifle .50 Receiver:\r<br />\r<br />[u]Old Description:[/u] Exceptional Damage. Changes ammo type to .50 Caliber. Improved rate of fire.\r<br />&#34;Exceptional&#34; they said. &#34;Improved&#34; they said. Join the vaguey, they said.\r<br />\r<br />[u]Better Mod Descriptions:[/u] +75% Damage. Uses .50 Rounds. +25% Fire Rate. -25% Reload Time.\r<br />+75% Damage? Don&#39;t mind if I do&#33; +25% Fire Rate? Yes please&#33; Wait, .50 Receivers decrease the Reload Time too? Who knew&#33;\r<br />\r<br />These kinds of changes have been applied to all armor and weapon mods (including unique items/effects and legendary modifiers) in the game, revealing actual numbers and sometimes even previously unknown modifiers for those who like their descriptions actually, well, descriptive.\r<br />\r<br />Prefer it in video format?

                "description": "Recommended to create a save before using this mod to revert to if something goes wrong. \n<br />\n<br />[b]Russian Version[/b]\n<br />\n<br />http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/19765/?\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Update v7 fixes culling issues in Andrews station attached to the mission \"along time coming.\" This update also added npc control points to prevent the whole map from rushing the player for the whole map. \n<br />\n<br />Update v6 adds a new station layout, the new layout is used for concord station, airport station, a new station is added at Monsignor Plaza and as well as tunnel connecting Goodneighbor and Malden station. An abandoned tunnel was added to connect Glowsea to West Roxbury Station.\n<br />\n<br />This mod connects 90% of the standard subway stations, and creates a network of subway tunnels filled with raiders, super mutants, synths and ghouls. Subway stations have been added throughout this network. With a focus on survival play through there are easy to access to beds for save points to bunk down for the night. This system once cleared out of enemies allows the player to move quickly across the wasteland. Be warned the battles to take back the network and make them safe for travel will be not an easy one. \n<br />\n<br />The maps are fully nav meshed and companion friendly. \n<br />I recommend using companion whistle to keep them close, especially if you are using more the one companion. \n<br />\n<br />This mod is large and modifies some world spaces to allow access to the subway network. I to care to avoid settlement locations and areas that could conflict with other mods.\n<br />\n<br />To gain access to Good Neighbor you must complete the quest “The Big Dig” otherwise the station is inaccessible from the surface.  I did this as 3rd rail is often used by other modders as a player home. \n<br />\n<br />[b][u]Not compatible with underhouse mod.\n<br />\n<br />[/u][/b]There are some issues with other immersive mods, notably stumble upon, interior and bean town. \n<br />\n<br />You will have to play with load order to get them all to work together. \n<br />\n<br />Currently I have interior over hall, then subway runner, bean town and stumble upon, I am still playing through a play through with this order but it appears to work.\n<br />\n<br />There is no plans to incorporate dlc. I purchased the season pass for ps4 when we were promised mods, have no intention of paying another $70 for dlc I already own. \n<br />\n<br />My to-do list for future updates, I will check them off as I go and upload hopefully 1 big update.\n<br />\n<br />Move light sources away from the walls,\n<br />\n<br />Remove 2-3 loot tables from each cell as they are noticeably over represent.\n<br />\n<br />Try to figure out why the grenade arks are not present\n<br />\n<br />Add more rubble to prevent pop up and noticeable draw distance. \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][center][u][size=6]Links to GHOST FC3S's other projects\n<br />[/size][b]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/38314][size=3]Survival First Aid[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/38314][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/thumbnails/38314/38314-1554304183-1006702144.jpeg[/img][/url][/b][/u]\n<br />\n<br />[b][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/36006][size=3]Ammo boxes to mags[/size][/url]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/36006][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/thumbnails/36006/36006-1542686556-569258488.jpeg[/img]\n<br />[/url][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/35712]RU556 Armoury Project\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/thumbnails/35712/35712-1541624148-1458128811.jpeg[/img]﻿\n<br />\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/33088]No main quest - Wasteland Operator mod[/url]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/33088][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/thumbnails/33088/33088-1531035112-736160208.jpeg[/img]\n<br />[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/30927]Galac-Tac\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/thumbnails/30927/30927-1522788284-769146834.jpeg[/img]﻿\n<br />\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/27244]Minuteman's Last Stand\n<br />[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/27244][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/thumbnails/27244-0-1507655660.jpg[/img][/url]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/18639]Subway Runner[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/18639]\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/thumbnails/18639-2-1474432422.jpg[/img]\n<br />\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/16476]Kerberos Panzer Cop Jin Roh The wolf\n<br />\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/16476][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/thumbnails/16476-4-1469059341.jpg[/img][/url]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/31605]FROST Craftable Liquor with VALDACIL tag[/url]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/31605][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/thumbnails/31605/31605-1525698743-1898567590.jpeg[/img]\n<br />[/url]\n<br />[/center][/b]",

This issue is exemplified in the raider faction which will attack the player regardless of what the player does.This mod will allow the player to infiltrate raider camps assuming he can either avoid patrols or talk his way in.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />What this mod adds.\r<br />-All raiders neutral as standard\r<br />-All raider area containers both interior and exterior are now owned by raiders - no stealing&#33;\r<br />-Raider crime faction that will make the player hostile for 24 hours if they upset a group of raiders.\r<br />-All raiders have guard packages that will warn you off and attack if you dawdle too long.\r<br />- Unique lookout npcs that will challenge the player [u]if detected[/u]. The raider will have opportunities in dialogue to talk his way past the guard but if he fails or runs off then the lookout will trigger a nearby siren.\r<br />-lookouts have 3 sets of random dialogue (unvoiced)\r<br />-Sirens are placed in virtually every raider interior/ exterior as are lookouts who often have guard dog followers.\r<br />-4 unique raider npcs with location based dialogue that will give you the opportunity to talk your way into an area.\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;m looking to add to and continue working on this mod over time especially if people like it. \r<br />First port of call would be getting some voice actors who sound like they fit in with the fallout 4 raiders&#33;\r<br />I am also considering adding more unique raider quests and adding more facets to the raider camps like caged guard dogs that are released by the alarms and perhaps reinforcements&#33;\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />UPDATES:  The dialogue was wonky and was not working as intended. This should be solved now in the latest version of the mod&#33; I have added blank dialogue as a placeholder which means you can skip dialogue if you want to. I&#39;ve added Lilly into Corvega interior now. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />REQUIREMENTS: Turn on your subtitles because dialogue is currently unvoiced. No dlc or mod requirements.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Conflicts : Nothing unless it changes the raider actor ai I believe",

Know the status and fighting strength of your team at all times.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f6b26b][font=Courier New][size=5][b]★ REQUIREMENTS ★[/b][/size][/font][/color]\n<br />\n<br />This mod requires [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/20309/]HUDFramework[/url].\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f6b26b][font=Courier New][size=5][b]★ COMPATIBILITY ★[/b][/size][/font][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Automatically compatible with all follower systems, vanilla or mod-added, present or future.\n<br />\n<br />All that's required is for followers to have the [i]Treat as Player Follower[/i] flag correctly set on their AI packages. This is set by default on the FollowPlayer package template, so a mod would have to be doing things in a very different way indeed in order to not have it set.\n<br />\n<br />Fully compatible with:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Vanilla follower system\n<br />[*]Temporary quest followers\n<br />[*]Everybody's Best Friend \n<br />[*]Unlimited Companion Framework\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f6b26b][font=Courier New][size=5][b]★ HOW DO I... ★[/b][/size][/font][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Q. Position the HUD widget?\n<br />A: Enter the console command [code][cqf companionstatus setpos &lt;x position&gt; &lt;y position&gt;][/code].\n<br />    Or the command [code][cqf companionstatus modpos &lt;x or y&gt; &lt;value&gt;][/code] to move the widget relative to its current position.\n<br />\n<br />Q. Scale the HUD widget?\n<br />A: Enter the console command [code][cqf companionstatus setscale &lt;value between 0 and 1&gt;][/code].\n<br />\n<br />Q. Set the opacity of the HUD widget?\n<br />A: Enter the console command [code][cqf companionstatus setopacity &lt;value between 0 and 1&gt;][/code].\n<br />\n<br />All these commands can be copied and pasted into the console.\n<br />\n<br />Sorry about making you use the console to do things like positioning and scaling. Until we have a MCM with fancy sliders, though, this will have to do! The upside is that you only need to configure just once - your settings are saved. Set and forget.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f6b26b][font=Courier New][size=5][b]★ GIF ★[/b][/size][/font][/color]\n<br />[spoiler][center][img]http://i.giphy.com/KWonzcPlqFCRq.gif[/img][/center][/spoiler]\n<br />[color=#f6b26b][font=Courier New][size=5][b]★ MORE HUD WIDGETS ★[/b][/size][/font][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/20300/]HoloTime - HUD Clock Widget[/url]\n<br />\n<br />Related mods:\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/21636/]Nameplates - Floating Healthbars[/url] by expired6978\n<br />Great if you want to see the health of everyone in combat!

hats\n<br />ArmorBodyPartHead - helmets\n<br />ArmorBodyPartEyes - glasses/goggles\n<br />ClothingDogmeat + playerCannotEquip - Dogmeat only equipable\n<br />ArmorBodyPartChest - chest armor overlays\n<br />dn_PowerArmor_Helmet\n<br />dn_PowerArmor_LeftArm\n<br />dn_PowerArmor_LeftLeg\n<br />dn_PowerArmor_RightArm\n<br />dn_PowerArmor_RightLeg\n<br />dn_Powerarmor_Torso\n<br />\n<br />And that is it.  As you can see we're missing the same left/right arm/leg breakdown for armor overlay pieces (leather, combat armor, etc).  We're also missing an standard keywords on clothing, armor suits, and the like.  The is also no Super Mutant keyword.\n<br />\n<br />This resource solves that problem by adding keywords to tag armor/cosmetics so that mod authors can properly classify their items.  See tutorial article attached to this page for more specifics.\n<br />\n<br />If you are creating a mod that adds new wearable items, use this resource and one of the keywords and follow the instructions outlined in this article, then your new items will be prepared for dynamic naming automatically with no need for compatibility patches.  The resource includes all vanilla items properly tagged and prepared for dynamic naming.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#a4c2f4][size=4]Instructions for Mod Authors[/size][/color]\n<br />--------------------\n<br />Make ArmorKeywords.esm a master on your .esp and link it as a required file when you upload your mod to Nexus.\n<br />To override an item, start with the resource item and copy as override into your .esp.  All pieces to run dynamic naming are already set as detailed below.\n<br />To create a new item, start with a resource item that is close then copy as a new item into your .esp.  All pieces to run dynamic naming should carryover.  Adjust community keywords as needed to properly tag and classify your item.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#a4c2f4][size=4]Details[/size][/color]\n<br />---------------------\n<br />Dynamic naming works off the INNR records in FO4Edit (latest version calls these Instance Naming Rule).  These rules run as If...Then statements looking for keywords on the object and applying a piece of the item's name if a matching rule is found.\n<br />\n<br />However, by default many armor items don't run dynamic naming rules because they didn't have any upgrades available in vanilla.  In order to force them to run dynamic naming rules the INRD of the item records must be set to the EditorID of the rule to run for that item.  Additionally, the OBTS must have a minimal definition as follows (if the item already has OBTE defined, do not change it; below is only for items where OBTE is undefined):\n<br />\n<br />OBTE -

It's actually [url=http://www.creationkit.com/Grass]GRASS[/url] that's generated on the fly using [url=http://i.imgur.com/1HGfDY0.jpg]PARAMETERS[/url][url=http://i.imgur.com/tLekmPt.jpg] [/url]initialized when you launch the game. I'm essentially removing 1/4 of all the grass you don't see to try and net older systems a few additional FPS. \n<br />\n<br />You won't CTD because I didn't break precombines, swap any meshes or delete any references. Even if another mod uses junk I removed, the engine will still have all the necessary information to attempt to draw that junk at a density of 0. \n<br />\n<br />In the eyes of the engine it's all just grass to be processed, but to our human eyes it's grass mixed with a ton of insignificant objects. Objects that will no longer exist once you activate this esp.[/font]",

If you'd like to contribute to the mod or get some ideas of how you can tap into Workshop Framework (which was used as the foundation for WS+) head to the [url=https://github.com/kinggath/Workshop-Plus]Github repository[/url]﻿![/size]\n<br />[size=4]\n<br />God Simulator[/size]\n<br />\n<br />Workshop Plus will turn you into an invisible hand in the game world [b]while you are in workshop mode[/b]. All of the options below can be turned off.\n<br />\n<br />- [b]Flight[/b]: You actually fly while in Workshop Mode, no tcl necessary. This means you can still interact with things over and over without having to toggle tcl on and off.\n<br />\n<br />- [b]Super Speed[/b]: You move incredibly fast while in Workshop Mode, to quickly get to the sections of the settlement you want to work on. Can be set to +50%, +100%, or +200%.\n<br />\n<br />- [b]Invulnerability[/b]: You won't take damage, or more importantly rads while in Workshop Mode - no more accidental death when working on your settlements.\n<br />\n<br />- [b]Invisibility[/b]: You will be completely ignored by NPCs while in Workshop Mode, so you can focus on your building. This also gives you the power to convert the game into full blown Tower Defense with the appropriate mods.\n<br />\n<br />- [b]Free Build[/b]: No more building materials required to build and bypasses perk requirements on workshop objects (they will still show the lock icon but can be built anyway). This option defaults to OFF because it prevents scrapping from returning resources which would be confusing.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]Hotkeys (Require MCM)[/size]\n<br />\n<br />- [b]Clone[/b]: Pick up an item, press a key, you have a copy. If you have Place Everywhere, this even works with things you don't have construction records for - that means you can clone every item in the game, even normally scrap only things, or props and buildings from Sim Settlements!\n<br />\n<br />- [b]Undo/Redo[/b]: Over 1000 levels of undo support! Set up hotkeys and you can undo movements, placements, and scrapping with the press of a button. \n<br />\n<br />   ﻿Notes on Undo/Redo \n<br />   ﻿    ﻿- If you undo the movement of a wired object, the wire will still be where it was when you moved the object - you'll need to reattach the wire yourself - but the power will still run even if you don't.\n<br />   ﻿   ﻿- Each time you enter a new settlement, your undo history is cleared.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]Layers[/size]\n<br />\n<br />Layers allow you to separate items and quickly hide or even duplicate them! This gives you the power of programs like Photoshop in your settlement. \n<br />\n<br />- [b]Multiple Layers[/b]: Up to 16 layers per settlement (1 is the default layer)\n<br />\n<br />- [b]Duplication[/b]: Entire Layers can be duplicated, allowing you to create a structure, make a copy, and then thanks to the toggle Display/Linking move your copy all at once anywhere you want in your settlement!\n<br />\n<br />- [b]Deletion[/b]: Transfer items between layers or even scrap them all in one go!\n<br />\n<br />- [b]Visual HUD[/b]:  [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/20309]HUDFramework[/url] integration to provide a visual module to help you use the Layers system.\n<br />\n<br />-[b] Toggle Display[/b]: Hide all of the items on a layer instantly, then re-display them again just as quickly.\n<br />\n<br />- [b]Toggle Linking[/b]: Unlinked items won't be picked up by Group Select, so you can separate out your items on to different levels so you can pull out the groups of items you want and move them in a group.\n<br />\n<br />- [b]Highlighting[/b]: Highlighting tools and toggles help you quickly identify which of your items are on a given layer.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]Workshop Save*[/size]\n<br />\n<br />*While this isn't the holy grail of being able to actually save in workshop mode and avoid having to wait for the transition - it can at least save you some steps and hopefully prevent you from ever losing much work in your design when the game engine decides to crash.\n<br />\n<br />- Automatically exits you from workshop mode, and then puts you back in when it finishes saving.\n<br />\n<br />- Hotkey available with MCM.\n<br />\n<br />- Autosave option allows you to set a certain amount of time in Workshop mode where the game will automatically save.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=6]How To Use[/size]\n<br />\n<br />The \"God Simulator\" things will happen automatically when you enter Workshop Mode. To control the options, either access the MCM menu, or if you aren't using it, go to a Chem Workbench and craft the Workshop Plus Controls holotape under Utility.\n<br />\n<br />To use the Layer system without hotkeys, go to a Chem Workbench and craft the Layer Control Module under Utility. You can Favorite this item and activate it to bring up options. \n<br />\n<br />MCM allows you to use hotkeys in Workshop mode and is definitely the preferred way to control layers - so if you find it obnoxious to jump in and out of Workshop mode to work with layers - grab MCM and set up those hotkeys!\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]The Future\n<br />\n<br />[/size]- Continue to expand on the features available to make Workshop Mode feel more and more like a creative tool.\n<br />- Copy layers to other settlements.\n<br />- Export layers for importing into different save files.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]Special Thanks[/size]\n<br />\n<br />The [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/28599]Rise of the Commonwealth[/url] team for constantly bitching about how bad Workshop Mode is, which inspired me to make this! \n<br />\n<br />Woodfuzzy, Krazyhorse, and Moonbeam for testing the crap out of this so I could feel comfortable releasing it...",

New enemies will seek you out and try to kill you and can find you no matter where you are and will find ways into your settlement, after all they didn't make it this far without some skills.\n<br />Battles will become unpredictable and you will always be watching over your shoulder for the next Maniac who wants to steal what you have as well as random interactions where they are robbing or trying to attack a settlement.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Simply play as normal and eventually someone will come looking for you, be warned, this mod wasn't made to be easy and enemies spawn at high levels even from a new game. Sometimes you will have to just run, but they wont give up their pursuit once they see your loot.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />The aim is to be a realistic mod and may sometimes appear unbalanced as a result \n<br />\n<br />When resting, enemies that are currently looking for you may catch up and appear when you wake. \n<br />\n<br />[/size][/color][color=#ff0000][size=5][b][u]New enemy types:\n<br />[/u][/b][/size][/color][color=rgb(255,255,255)][size=3][b]\n<br />[/b][u]Bandits [/u]\n<br />The most common type of enemy, they want your stuff.

They are tasked by their Bandit group to find new targets and hunt them down, they have also been known to call in reinforcements if they cant take down their target\n<br />\n<br />[b][u]Stalkers[/u][/b]\n<br />\n<br />Carrying advanced tech, these enemies are rare but use stealth tech to hide and ambush you, if you take high tech items (such as an advanced alien weapon) these enemies will seek you out. They are rare, but cannot be targeted in vats, are almost invisible and use high tech grenades and laser weapons\n<br />\n<br />[b][u]Hunter Killers[/u][/b]\n<br />\n<br />Highly dangerous cyborgs, they were once escaped synths but something went wrong.

Do not use the 'kill all' command in the command console, this will break the mod, even If you cant see any enemies around.\n<br />\n<br />2. Sometimes killing an enemy, loading a earlier save and playing again will cause them to never spawn again, unknown why3\n<br />\n<br />3. IMPORTANT, I suggest you turn off sleeping in survival mode and do no rest, as enemies will tend to fast travel to you, this is not intended",

                "description": "[size=3]I highly recommend using this towards end game or game saves in which you have been playing a long long time or on survival play through to help combat save bloat. \n<br />\n<br />Q: What is save bloat?\n<br />A: In open world games were everything is moveable the game needs to create a record of that move. For example your in a fire fight and you miss and hit a beer bottle sending it flying. The game with then keep a record where that bottle landed so the next time you enter that cell it will still be there that record is save until there is a cell reset. Every time you build something in your settlement it keeps a record of that. ANNNNDDDD every time you kill something it keeps a record of that. F04 has built in scrubbers to remove dead bodies and cell change records after a period of time. Default is 24 ingame hours for bodies and Cells (world spaces) for non survival is 7 in day games survival is 80 I believe. \n<br />As the f04 builds records of all your activities the save file gets larger and larger.  If you have modified time scale and respawn/cell reset mods, save times get even larger.  I use Zombie Walkers mod which is always spawning zombies, (or if you use fo4 76 mod) you will end up with alot of dead bodies quickly resulting in long save time + 3-5 minutes per save. With this activated my save time drops down to under 5 seconds. \n<br />\n<br />My current save is 2400 hours survival with large settlement builds time scale at 10 and zombie mods, ﻿with this activated my save time drops to under 5 seconds for hard saves.  The only downside is to make sure you loot bodies right away.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />This mod is light weight and only changes the iHoursToClearCorpses from 24 hours to 1. \n<br />\n<br />How to use, Install with nmm or Manual install. I suggest dropping it at the bottom of the load order to fight dirty edits. Activate it. Go to a interior cell wait 2 hours then save. When you return to cells that you have previously had engaged in combat and left piles of dead bodies they will now be gone.   \n<br />\n<br />For the change to be effective you must leave the cell wait 2  in Game Hours. If you return before 1 ingame hour is up, fo4 will reset the timer and the bodies will remain.\n<br />\n<br />I included a txt/bat file in the zip archive for people not wanting to increase there mod list. \n<br />\n<br />Drop the .txt file into your main fo4 directory (not your data directory) start the game open the console type Bat corpse it will activate. You should only need to run it once for a play through. However if it does rest on you just run the bat again.  \n<br />\n<br />To check type ﻿﻿getgs ihourstoclearcorpses and it will show you the value.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br /> [/size][size=6]Links to GHOST FC3S's other projects[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/36006]Ammo boxes to mags[/url]﻿[/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/36006][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/thumbnails/36006/36006-1542686556-569258488.jpeg[/img][/url]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/35712]RU556 Armoury Project\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/thumbnails/35712/35712-1541624148-1458128811.jpeg[/img]﻿\n<br />\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/33088]No main quest - Wasteland Operator mod[/url]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/33088][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/thumbnails/33088/33088-1531035112-736160208.jpeg[/img]\n<br />[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/30927]Galac-Tac\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/thumbnails/30927/30927-1522788284-769146834.jpeg[/img]﻿\n<br />\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/27244]Minuteman's Last Stand\n<br />[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/27244][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/thumbnails/27244-0-1507655660.jpg[/img][/url]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/18639]Subway Runner[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/18639]\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/thumbnails/18639-2-1474432422.jpg[/img]\n<br />\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/16476]Kerberos Panzer Cop Jin Roh The wolf\n<br />\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/16476][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/thumbnails/16476-4-1469059341.jpg[/img][/url]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/31605]FROST Craftable Liquor with VALDACIL tag[/url]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/31605][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/thumbnails/31605/31605-1525698743-1898567590.jpeg[/img][/url][size=3]\n<br />\n<br />[/size]",

HUDFramework solves this by dynamically loading individual interface mods into the HUD at runtime. It gives modders the tools to load custom widgets and communicate with their widgets.\r<br />\r<br />Note that you need to have a mod installed that uses the framework to see any widgets&#33; If you&#39;re looking for HUDFramework mods to install, there&#39;s a list on the sticky in the Comments section.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#f6b26b][font=Courier New][size=5][b]★ INSTALLATION ★[/b][/size][/font][/color]\r<br />\r<br />1. Install with your preferred mod manager, or copy the files in the download to your Fallout 4 Data folder.\r<br />2. Activate HUDFramework.esm in your mod manager, or via the Mods menu.\r<br />\r<br />Note: If you receive a message about overwriting HUDMenu.swf, then you have an existing UI mod installed. To use both together, you can inject HUDFramework into the other mod using the HUDFramework auto-patcher.

Now the builders will check the LargeItemFormList and output items appropriately. Also added a delay for building large items to prevent items from being thrown.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]Added better checking in the disassembler code to prevent papyrus errors. Also changed the way the disassemblers disposed of items. Now it is using a much more reliable method of removal and deletion of objects.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]Took another pass at the Armor FormList to ensure more items are correctly scrapped.

Thanks for the Assist pfarthing6![/size]\n<br />[/list]v.2.2.1 - Some small user requested changes\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][size=2]The weapon and armor scrappers now run on a shorter timer. This change is to speed up the scrapping process (Due to a possible engine error with Papyrus, not as fast as I would like). [/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]The main \"Better Manufacturing.esp\" is not tagged as an esm file and will operate like a standard esp file.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]Added back the standard Cutting Fluid recipe.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]All \"Gun\" weapons no longer require the BM keyword \"IsMachineScrapable\", making them far less likely to have any conflict with other mods.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]Made some small fixes to the type extractor to ensure it operates correctly. Ammo did not work correctly so I removed the ability to add that type altogether.[/size]\n<br />[/list][size=2]v.2.2 - Huge Patch. Adds quite a bit.\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]All disassemblers' scrap output has been adjusted to equalize the new armor scrap output. With the great extent of items it was very tedious to make the scrap out for each specific item. What I did instead was create generic scrap recipes and add randomization to them to add variation to scrapping and balance. Before, weapons and armor all scrapped to very close to normal vanilla scrapping on a workbench WITHOUT any randomization. Now they all have a low chance to double up on certain valuable resources, along with other random balances. \n<br />[*]The Armor Scrapper is now full functional on ALL items in the ARMOR category, that includes clothing, hats. facemasks, ect. I even got all of the armor from ArmorSmith extended since I'm using AWKCR keywords including the Jetpacks and weapon aesthetics! \n<br />[*]Armor pieces will also scrap without a BM keyword, meaning ANY other Mod that adds armor should be compatible with the Disassembler WITHOUT fo4edits (As long as they are tagged with AWKCR keywords or Vanilla Armor Keywords). \n<br />[*][color=#3c78d8]There is now a new Scrapper for Ammo! Due to the complexity of ammo scrapping, I had to add a separate machine. It scraps 25 of ANY ammo at a time, with the exception being large ammo items such as mini nukes. missiles, ect. [/color]\n<br />[*]Adds a brand new type extractor! Put an object of a certain type in and this pulls all objects of that type out of the local workbench onto a conveyor.[color=#ff0000] [/color][color=#00ff00]MUST READ: This Object required a very heavy operation involving the Workbench Inventory (One of the reasons this thing does not link). Because of that it actually LOCKS the workbench when this thing runs its search. If you attempt to access the inventory while it's processing all items will \"Appear\" to be missing. They are not, the workbench is just locked. I recommend one per settlement max (trust me, that's all you need)! [/color]\n<br />[*][color=#3c78d8]Adds the Equipment Sorter by steamcanuck.[/color]\n<br />[*]I also add Left Facing Sorters (All included)! These things are great and allow you to sort left as well. No more weird factory right only setups, or upward lifts everywhere! I also overwrote the scripts to use the BM Faster Hopper Script and tagged them to the Faster Hopper Terminal. That means they are now linked to your faster hopper terminal settings. \n<br />[*]I noticed downward lifts were not grabbing items correctly due to the Trigger point being too high. This patch fixes those so they have lower trigger points on ALL lifts. \n<br />[*][color=#3c78d8]Combined the Butcher and Robot Disassembler into one machine called the Body Decomposer and added a Large Hopper version as well! You know the one with the Huge Open top to make butchering easier. [/color]\n<br />[*]Added a bunch of missing items to the LargeItem Form List from the Contraptions DLC . This is aimed at fixing any hopper and builder when outputting large items. I even added Weaponsmith extended Large Items if you get that patch. \n<br />[/list]v.2.1.3 - Small Bug fixes.[color=#3c78d8] Adds ME Power Armor Kits to the Full Armor Builder[/color]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][u]BUG_FIX:[/u] Fixed the missing component value on Fat Scrap. \n<br />[*]This also significantly reduces the weight of fat scrap.

If you don't it can cause crashes and bugs as the machines are now using different scripts essentially an the ones already placed have no script to point to. This affects ANY and ALL BM machines and conveyors. I realize the hassle this presents and I apologize. These are things I am just now learning. \n<br />\n<br />If you downloaded any versions 1.5 - 1.9.4 you have a potential for problems with conveyors and builders that had more than 16 recipes. You will probably not see any immediate issues and maybe none at all but it is bad practice to overwrite a Vanilla Script and use that instead of creating your own script. The reason is that it introduces multiple versions  of the same script in your deploy directory. One in the BA2 file and one in Scripts/DLC05. As you can see that is not good, and the only reason it works is because the Scripts/ directory overwrites BA2's. I'm terribly sorry for this mistake, I'm still learning myself and these things happen. I fixed this in 1.9.5, please download the latest version ASAP.

                "description": "(RUS/ENG)\n<br />\n<br />[b]Описание: [/b]\n<br />Данный мод логическое продолжение [url=https://gamer-mods.ru/go?https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/26286?tab=description]Boston FPS Fix[/url] (сам мод Boston FPS Fix больше не требуется), мне очень понравился этот мод, но к сожалению он исправляет только Бостон. И я решил сделать свой мод который бы смог исправить все ошибки и дать большой + к FPS.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Что он делает?[/b]\n<br />Немногие знают что создатели Fallout 4 при добавлении DLC сломали самостоятельно около 30 ячеек в мире. Сломанные прекомбинации это то что дает нам огромное падение FPS во многих местах и особенно это видно в Бостоне. Данный мод полностью востанавливает ВСЕ ячейки Содружества. Все 4500 ячеек были сгенерированы с нуля.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Какой плюс от использования? [/b]\n<br />У вас будет большой прирост к фпс и абсолютная плавность игрового процесса.\n<br />[b]\n<br />[/b][b]Что требуется? [/b]\n<br />Оригинальный Fallout 4 + all DLC.\n<br />Неофициальный патч \n<br />\n<br />[b]Почему именно так? [/b]\n<br />Потому что DLC вносят изменения в ячейки также как патч в некоторые.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Совместимость: [/b]\n<br />Мод совместим с любыми текстурами:\n<br />[b]\n<br />[/b][b]Несовместимость: [/b]\n<br />Мод частично совместим с модами которые меняют расположение объектов в мире. \n<br />Если мод добавляет объекты а не перемещает стандартные объекты (столы,стулья,шкафы,стены) то он будет работать на 100%.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Патчи:[/b]\n<br />Многие моды потребуют патчи и я собираюсь их сделать со временем.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Порядок загрузки модов: [/b]\n<br />Данный мод следует загружать ПОСЛЕДНИМ ПОСЛЕ ВСЕХ МОДОВ и только так.\n<br />Все моды которые будут загружены ПОСЛЕ отменят воссозданные прекомбинации и сломают FPS в ячейках.\n<br />[b]\n<br />Description:[/b]\n<br />This mod is a logical continuation of[b] [/b][url=https://gamer-mods.ru/go?https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/26286?tab=description]Boston FPS Fix[/url] (the mod Boston FPS Fix is no longer required), I really liked this mod, but unfortunately it only fixes Boston. And I decided to make my own mod that could fix all the mistakes of the developers and give a big boost to FPS.\n<br />[b]\n<br />What does it do?[/b]\n<br />Few people know that the creators of Fallout 4 when adding DLC broke on their own about 30 cells in the world. Broken recombination is what gives us a huge drop in FPS in many places and this is especially evident in Boston. This mod completely restores all cells of the Commonwealth. All 4,500 cells were generated from scratch.\n<br />\n<br />[b]What is the advantage of using it?[/b]\n<br />You will have a large increase in fps and absolute smoothness of the game process.\n<br />\n<br />[b]What is required?[/b]\n<br />Original Fallout 4 + all DLC.\n<br />Unofficial patch\n<br />\n<br />[b]Why so?[/b]\n<br />Because DLC makes changes to cells just like a patch does to some. \n<br />\n<br />[b]Compatibility: [/b]\n<br />The mod is compatible with any textures:\n<br />\n<br />[b]Incompatibility: [/b]\n<br />The mod is partially compatible with mods that change the location of objects in the world. \n<br />If the mod adds objects instead of moving standard objects (tables,chairs,cabinets, walls), it will work 100%.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Patches:[/b]\n<br />Many mods will require patches and I'm going to make them over time.\n<br />[b]\n<br />How to load mods: [/b]\n<br />This mod should be loaded LAST AFTER all MODS and only so.\n<br />All mods that will be loaded AFTER will cancel the recreated recombinations and break the FPS in the cells.",

Visit me here about this or any other of my mods: [url=https://discord.gg/jMUnXDV]https://discord.gg/jMUnXDV[/url]\n<br />\n<br />Adapted and expanded from my mod \"[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/29957]Pack Attack[/url]\", this mod significantly extends the same concepts and ideas into a combat AI mod that specifically applies to biped gang enemies, such as Raiders and Gunners.  As in \"Pack Attack\", enemies using this mod will adjust their tactics based on their social and threat awareness, switching between ranged, melee, defensive, and offensive tactics based on their perceptions of team advantage and individual risk.  \n<br />\n<br />[b]Please note: Due to the rapid development and evolution of this mod, this description page may be incomplete, outdated, and/or inaccurate.[/b]  For the latest information, please read the comments section.  You can also find information about mod compatibility, MCM settings, and playing strategy in the Articles section.  \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]IMPORTANT[/b] \n<br />===================================\n<br />\n<br />Do [b]NOT[/b] use this and my original Pack Attack mod together!  That one was the original very crude prototype that gradually evolved into this mod, and Pack Attack NPC Edition (or PA-NPC, for short) includes and expands on all that mod's functionality.  They will not play nice together! \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]CHANGELOG[/b] \n<br />===================================\n<br />\n<br />To better keep track of everything and maintain my own sanity in the process, [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/articles/849]this mod's project changelog can be found here[/url].\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]DESCRIPTION[/b]\n<br />===================================\n<br />\n<br />\"[b]Pack Attack: NPC Edition[/b]\" applies the basic dog pack AI methodology from \"[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/29957]Pack Attack[/url]\" to NPC gangs, but significantly expands on it.\n<br />\n<br />This mod makes major changes to how supported NPC groups fight.  Rather than simply rushing you in the open as a group, these NPCs will break and cover, retreat and flank, run and hide, and even lie in wait.  They're more likely to ambush, less likely to engage in suicidal charges, and more certain to switch to hand-to-hand combat if you get too close and they like their odds.  In short, PA-NPC completely overhauls and upgrades the combat AI for all supported NPC groups.\n<br />\n<br />And they will attempt to make these tactical decisions based on what is happening around them.\n<br />\n<br />Each NPC gathers information from their experiences, coordinates information with their teammates, and even learns to a limited degree.  This leads to fights that are never the same twice, that actively require you to consider the risks versus rewards of a particular assault or combat approach.\n<br />\n<br />In addition, PA-NPC now contains several features for dynamic enemy spawning, non-combat AI, and upgrades/new abilities for individual NPC groups.  All in all, this project has now evolved into a general NPC upgrade for the entirety of the Fallout 4 experience.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]HOW PA-NPC DIFFERS FROM OTHER AI MODS[/b]\n<br />========================================\n<br />\n<br />There are many fine AI overhaul mods available on the Nexus.  They all basically do the same things: adjust the global game settings and update the combat style definitions.\n<br />\n<br />PA-NPC doesn't change globals, and rather than alter existing combat styles, it substitutes its own.  Where PA-NPC differs is that it adds an additional layer of processing on top of the combat style system.  Rather than having a single defined combat style (as in vanilla), PA-enabled animals have five of them, and biped NPCs (humans, etc.) have [i]nine different combat styles[/i], switching between them as their combat environment and relative perspective changes.  To the best of my knowledge, Pack Attack is the only Fallout AI mod to have attempted this.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Important note: many AI mods, such as Arbitration and Search and Destroy, \"improve\" NPC attack behavior by making the vanilla system overall much more sensitive.  PANPC doesn't need the help.  Using them together will have unintended consequences.[/b]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]SPECIAL NOTE ABOUT F4SE[/b]\n<br />========================================\n<br />\n<br />[i]As of v1.7, I have retired the non-F4SE version of PANPC.  The honest truth is that it's a hassle to support both user bases, and the non-F4SE base isn't large enough to justify it.  I may release bugfixes for it once in a while, but for now, v1.69 will be the final, canon non-F4SE version of PANPC.[/i]\n<br />\n<br />The aim of this project is to improve the general enemy AI as much as possible through the use of group dynamics and tactics.  To that end, I prefer not to leave any useful tools lying on the table, and without question that includes F4SE.\n<br />\n<br />There are now two general releases of PA-NPC.  The main release requires F4SE, and utilizes that additional capability to include factors such as detailed weapon comparison (i.e., don't take a pipe gun to a Gauss Gun fight).  This will always be the primary release version, and while not every new feature will be based on F4SE functions, any new features incorporated into this release WILL NOT be backported to non-F4SE version.\n<br />\n<br />The non-F4SE version remains version 1.69, and is available under Optional Files.  I will continue to maintain this version only for critical (i.e., game breaking) bug fixes.  Do not ask me to backport.  If you want the new features, install F4SE.\n<br />\n<br />Beyond simply not wanting to maintain two separate mods here, my other concern is game balancing.  I spend a lot of time testing, tweaking, and testing again, and balancing takes a lot of time.  As new features are included, I would have to do all that work separately for each version, and I'm not going to do that.  Thanks for understanding.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]HOW IT WORKS[/b]\n<br />========================================\n<br />\n<br />[b]IMPORTANT POINT:[/b] The Fallout 4 engine is designed to allow for the influence of combat behavior, but not the [i]control[/i] of combat behavior (with a few exceptions).  All this or any other mod can do is coax an actor into a certain level of aggression and combat behavior.  So expect some strange behavior - once the combat starts, the NPCs are making their own decisions, and they may not always be the brightest ones.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />This mod had its genesis in its predecessor mod, \"Pack Attack\".  Pack Attack upgraded the Commonwealth's canines, emulating basic pack behavior and social awareness in combat situations.  When a PA-enabled Mongrel is loaded into the game, it does an immediate scan for other dogs, and acts more confidently and aggressively when it has company. \n<br />\n<br />In the vanilla game, an Actor (you, me, dogs, robots, etc.) has an Aggression stat (how likely it is to attack), a Confidence stat (cowardly/brave/foolhardy), and a general Combat Style (which specifies combat behavior in more detail).  Normally these stats are hardwired into Actors, including dogs.  If an Actor is a coward, they're usually - but not always - a coward forever.  But those stats can be changed on the fly.  \"Pack Attack\" constantly adjusted those settings for each dog as its fortunes changed in combat.\n<br />\n<br />PA-NPC takes that same basic idea and expands it significantly for use with NPC gang enemies.  When a PA-NPC is active, he (or she) will perform regular scans of the local environment and assess the local relative strength of his gang.  If he finds other faction-friendly teammates in the area, he will act more confidently and aggressively.  If he's alone and hurt, he's more likely to run and hide.\n<br />\n<br />In addition, PA-NPC actors consider:\n<br />\n<br />* [b]High ground advantage[/b]: \"Am I fairly safe up on this freeway or rooftop?\"\n<br />* [b]Visible weapon comparisons[/b]: \"Am I bringing a knife to a gunfight?\"\n<br />* [b]Power Armor advantage[/b]: \"Am I wearing power armor?  Is my target?\"\n<br />* [b]Outnumbering advantage[/b]: \"Am I feeling pretty good about our numbers here?\"\n<br />* [b]Group aggression[/b]: \"Does it feel like we're winning this battle?\"\n<br />* [b]Target distance[/b]: \"Is my target close enough to warrant a shift to hand-to-hand or melee combat?\"\n<br />* [b]Self preservation[/b]: \"Is the smartest move here to run away and fight another day?\"\n<br />* [b]Radiation exposure:[/b] \"Am I currently taking radiation damage?\" (new to v1.7)\n<br />\n<br />.. and much more.\n<br />\n<br />PA-NPC uses more combat styles than the original Pack Attack did, and each NPC will shift styles as necessary between ranged, melee, and evasion tactics.  As the gang dwindles in size, it will lose battle cohesion.  If, on the other hand, the gang is winning, they will become bolder and more direct in their fire tactics.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Here are the important concepts:\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]COURAGE[/b]\n<br />========================================\n<br />\n<br />Each PA-NPC, when first enabled, is assigned a random value within a faction-specified range that represents their natural courage.  This value will rise and fall as the NPC gains experience and faces combat events.  In general, a higher courage NPC is more likely to be confident and aggressive, as well as more willing to make command decisions.  A lower courage NPC will be a follower more than a leader, be more apt to run and evade than charge and fight, and will more prefer fighting at a distance to up-close-and-personal slugfests.\n<br />\n<br />The rest of this mod is based around this Courage value, which remains as long as the NPC reference is alive.  In a very simple but very real way, they \"learn\" and individualize as they gain experience.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]SELF PRESERVATION[/b]\n<br />========================================\n<br />\n<br />Countering the NPC's Courage stat is their Self Preservation stat.  While not nearly as important to their decisions as is Courage, the NPC's SP stat will generally lower when they make kills or participate in command or revenge actions.  It will rise as they take damage and when they flee.  Self Preservation generally works against Courage, as the NPC attempts to decide whether to boldly attack, retreat, flank, or run for the hills.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]GANG EVALUATION[/b]\n<br />===================================\n<br />\n<br />As with \"Pack Attack\", the heart of this mod is the gang assessment system.  Each active NPC is constantly searching within a dynamic radius (based on its Perception stat) for other friends and enemies.  When it finds another friendly NPC, it evaluates that NPC's base health in comparison to its own, using that data to get a rough (and relative) collective estimate of the gang strength.  \n<br />\n<br />Here is how it works.  Imagine we're talking about two raiders: Tiny Tim and Big Bubba.\n<br />\n<br />Tiny Tim has a base health of 50HP.  Big Bubba, on the other hand, is a much bigger guy: 150HP base health.  Tim is going to look at Bubba and think, \"Wow, that guy is three times my size and he's on OUR side.  We can't lose!\" and be more reckless as a result. Bubba, meanwhile, is more likely to look down at Tiny Tim and think, \"I'm surrounded by guys a third of my size, and I'm going to have to do all the work here.  This is not a great situation for me.\"  He will be more likely to hang back and fight conservatively.\n<br />\n<br />Each PA-NPC makes this assessment with each allied or friendly NPC in their scan radius, using the sum of those judgments as a base to assess the overall strength of the gang - from their own point of view.  There is no \"objective\" pack strength.  It's all relative, each NPC making imperfect decisions based on their own individual perspective.\n<br />\n<br />Each NPC has a random bravery/anxiety factor that will make it a bit more anxious or bold than the others (to avoid duplicating behavior), and utilizes various other data points - wounded enemies (blood scent), its own health, and its most recent combat experience - to decide whether to attack, run away, be cautious, or go completely bloodthirsty insane.  That base \"courage\" value goes up and down as the NPC gets hit, or makes kills.  It is then used as the base for future evaluation calculations.\n<br />\n<br />In general, as each NPC senses a weaker and more damaged pack, it will become more and more likely to retreat, evade, and hide.  Likewise, if another NPC enters the fray, the other NPCs will react to the gang's suddenly improved fortunes and become more aggressive.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]FIGHT/FLIGHT[/b]\n<br />========================================\n<br />\n<br />PA-NPC enemies operate in two basic modes: proactive and reactive.  A proactive decision is a measured appraisal of the gang dynamics and tactical situation, followed by a random timeout period of up to 30 seconds before reconsidering their decision.\n<br />\n<br />During the timeout period, the NPC is in reactive mode.  Their decision making process is much simpler, more fight/flight.  In this mode, the enemy NPC is much more likely to do something stupid, more likely to aggressively defend themselves, and more likely to run in panic.  They will continue in this reactive decision mode until the timeout expires, at which point they'll make another proactive tactical decision.\n<br />\n<br />Each proactive decision changes the NPC's aggression and confidence stats, as well as their combat style.  There are melee and ranged, offensive and defensive fighting styles. \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]COMMAND (FOCUSED FIRE)[/b]\n<br />========================================\n<br />\n<br />Certain factions - Gunners, Minutemen, Brotherhood, and Synths - now have what I call the Command ability.  When a member of one of these factions gains a kill or two and raises their courage, the script will sometimes assign them a Command token that they can then spend on a high profile target (such as an enemy in power armor, or someone exposed on high ground).  When they spend that token, the target is marked as a Command target, and nearby teammates will prioritize their fire focus on that target.  The NPC that makes the kill gets a substantial courage bonus.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]FRIENDS AND ENEMIES[/b]\n<br />========================================\n<br />\n<br />PA-NPC enemies will only count faction-friendly NPCs as part of their gang.  This means in certain situations, it's entirely possible to have multiple NPC gangs slugging it out using PA-NPC tactic sets. \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]STEALTH, LOW LIGHT, DETECTION[/b]\n<br />========================================\n<br />\n<br />PA-NPC enemies make decisions based on what they can see and hear.  LOS (Line of Sight) between NPCs is a big deal, and LOS is mitigated by a variety of factors, first and foremost low light.  Staying in shadows, moving at night, and generally not making a good target of yourself are all tactics that play larger roles in PANPC than they do in the vanilla game.  Crouch-sneaking, Sneak perks, high AGL, and avoiding LOS are all excellent tools for avoiding unprepared-for combat situations.\n<br />\n<br />Likewise, PA-NPC enemies are MUCH more aware of their environments than are their vanilla counterparts.  They will investigate noise, set ambushes, and will tend to be quieter (fewer \"barks\") when they are alone or relatively isolated.  So be careful, because your enemies are going to be careful, too.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]DAZZLE[/b] (v1.771+ only)\n<br />========================================\n<br />\n<br />As of v1.771, PA-NPC enemies can be rendered temporarily (3-5 seconds) blind to the PANPC scanning systems.  During this period, they will take minor Perception damage, their aim will be severely degraded, and a large portion of their attempts to visually identify both targets and allies will fail.  They will take a minor courage hit, and if they are already having courage issues, they will be more prone to panic and retreat.\n<br />\n<br />This effect will naturally trigger from time to time in the regular game when NPCs are exposed to sudden increases in light brightness.  \n<br />\n<br />For players who prefer a more reliable method for dazzling their enemies, the PANPC download now includes an optional ESP that adds PANPC-enabled flash grenades and flash mines to the game.  They're adapted from their pulse cousins, do very little damage, explode with 1/10 of the force, and have about 50% more range.  NPCs caught in the explosion radius have a 50% chance of being dazzled (33% if the NPC is equipped with optics).\n<br />\n<br />PANPC flash weapons should start appearing in loot and vendor lists at around level 10, and I'm not doing injector lists, so you'll need to reconcile the lists in FO4Edit if you have other mods statically adding grenades and mines to those lists.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]SNIPER[/b] (v1.78+ only)\n<br />========================================\n<br />\n<br />As of v1.78, PA-NPC enemies that are spawned armed with a ballistic weapon equipped with a long range mod (such as long barrel) will adopt an extended set of fire tactics, in addition to their normal actions.  These \"Snipers\" will crouch when they fire (for an aim bonus), will prefer ranged attacks from held, fixed positions, and will attempt to fight from the rear of groups while their comrades lead frontal assaults.  If a Sniper also has a scope mod on their weapon, they will get an additional 20% aim bonus, stacking with whatever other aim bonuses they currently have.  Finally, they will also have a 50% better view of the battlefield than their teammates.\n<br />\n<br />Synths and super mutants do not use Sniper actions, no matter what weapon they are using.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]EXTRA SPAWNS[/b]\n<br />========================================\n<br />\n<br />Disabled by default, this feature allows you to automatically spawn in additional enemies when a PA-enabled NPC is loaded into game memory for the first time.  The new enemies will be spawned from that NPC's leveled list, each with its own equipment and configuration.\n<br />\n<br />In the MCM menu, you can adjust the odds of each NPC cloning a new spawn, how many possible spawns they can clone, and overall odds for generating the new clone NPC as a Boss, Higher Level, Tougher than PC, or PC-equal level.\n<br />\n<br />For more information about this (or any other) MCM feature, read the MCM instructions in the Articles section.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]RAIDING PARTIES[/b]\n<br />========================================\n<br />\n<br />Much like the extra spawns/clones, the Raiding Parties option (also enabled via MCM) occasionally sets a small group of enemies against you.  The type of enemy generally depends on the dominant gang in the area, and you can adjust the time interval and makeup of the groups in MCM.  They may come right at you, but they will most likely sneak up on and ambush you from a relatively safe spot.  \n<br />\n<br />You can adjust the time interval as a matter of game hours: every hour, two hours, etc.  But this is only a general time, and a new raiding party will spawn into your vicinity at any point between 30 minutes before or 30 minutes after the set interval.  If you have the interval set to 2 hours, for example, the script will spawn a new raiding party anywhere between 1.5 hours and 2.5 hours since the last one.\n<br />\n<br />If Raiding Parties and Extra Spawns are both enabled, the party will split up and each member will lead their own band of clones against your position. \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]INTEGRATION WITH WEST TEK OPTICS[/b]\n<br />========================================\n<br />\n<br />As of v1.74, PANPC now includes integration with [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/12220]\"West Tek Tactical Optics\" by fadingsignal[/url].  If you have WTTO installed, NPCs (including companions) with WTTO optics gear in their inventories will equip them at night and in low light.  NPCs with optics will not suffer from low light LOS (line of sight) penalties, while giving them a 20% aim bonus and greater team cohesion abilities.  \n<br />\n<br />The player does not receive any special bonuses in PANPC from West Tek Optics.  \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]CONFLICTS AND ISSUES[/b]\n<br />========================================\n<br />\n<br />While fairly stable at this point, this mod is still very experimental and SIGNIFICANTLY changes how NPCs fight.  All these changes are bound within the faction system (without changing any factions), and so hopefully should not break any quests.  However, I can't guarantee that any particular version of this mod is perfectly ironclad, is save game safe, or won't CTD somewhere.\n<br />\n<br />If you happen to encounter a situation where you believe this mod is breaking your game, please let me know in as much detail as possible.  If you think you've found a bug, [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/articles/1895]please read this article[/url] as well as the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/articles/821]Compatibility Status[/url] page before reporting it.  Thanks.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]INSTALLATION/UNINSTALLATION[/b]\n<br />========================================\n<br />\n<br />As of v1.7, only the base game and F4SE 0.4.0+ are required.  The script will auto detect any DLCs and make the appropriate settings.\n<br />\n<br />Likewise, the v1.69 legacy non-F4SE version is also fully DLC compatible, but does not require F4SE.\n<br />\n<br />While MCM is required to use the MCM features, it is not required for using either version of this mod.\n<br />\n<br />Unpack the RAR to install, disable the ESP in your load order to disable. \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]DONATIONS[/b]\n<br />========================================\n<br />\n<br />Always appreciated, never required.  I do this stuff because I'm a hopeless Fallout addict, have been for a long time, and like pulling out the wires to see what sparks.  Donations via Nexus are awesome and will result in a note of generous thanks.\n<br />\n<br />All donations go directly to an important cause: my personal gaming fund.  Your donations allow me to play better games, use more of my time to play them, and dedicate more of my energy to making cool mods for them.  (And yes, Fallout will always be my first love.)\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]AS ALWAYS..[/b]\n<br />========================================\n<br />\n<br />Thanks to my wife (Borderlands Assist Queen, fellow gamer, console girl, and partner in crime) for tolerating my Fallout fandom.\n<br />\n<br />Thanks to Eden, our yellow Labrador, who is currently away nursing her new puppies and being a good momma.  We miss her and look forward to her coming home.\n<br />\n<br />Thanks to everyone who has downloaded, enjoyed, and perhaps even endorsed any of my mods for Fallout 4 and New Vegas.  I write these weird little mods for myself, to try things out that hopefully keep the game interesting for me a little while longer, and it's nice to know that some of you good folks enjoy them, too.  I appreciate the kind words, support, and occasional gamer angst.\n<br />\n<br />I have no intention of porting any of my mods to console.  I'm a PC player, and diving into the Bethesda.net pool doesn't interest me in the least.\n<br />\n<br />This mod is still in regular development, meaning you should expect some bugs and items that need to be rebalanced.  Your game saves, however, should be fairly safe at this point.  Try it out and leave your feedback in the comments.  I want to hear them!\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]ABOUT ME[/b]\n<br />========================================\n<br />\n<br />[b]See my other Fallout 4 mods:[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/23558/?]Stash Those Caps[/url] - Makes caps truly portable again, just like in FO3/FNV\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/23269/?]Insult To Injury[/url] - Implements a working FNV-like limb damage/recovery system in Survival mode\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/22744/?]Companion Heal Thyself[/url] - Give companions the power to patch themselves\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/22585/?]Passive Aggressive Piper[/url] - Add affinity checks to Piper's more annoying, sarcastic and flirtatious comments\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/22434/?]Ferals After Dark[/url] - Makes feral ghouls a bit smarter and more dangerous after the sun goes down\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/22436/?]More Realistic Cats[/url] - Buffs the cat race to make them behave more like, well, cats\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/23498/?]Atomic Brahmin[/url] - When cows turn into mean, aggressive, highly unstable nuclear weapons\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/29957]Pack Attack[/url] - Mongrel dogs shift attack behavior based on social awareness and threat assessment",

                "description": "[u][size=6][b]Overview[/b][/size][/u]\n<br />\n<br />A simple mod that makes it unsafe to rest in uninhabited areas at night. Your sleep can be interrupted by an enemy ambush or any number of wasteland creatures. \n<br />\n<br />[center]\n<br />[youtube]MX2pBOFXxzU[/youtube][/center]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][u]Requirements[/u][/size]\n<br />\n<br />Sleepless Nights was compiled with Fallout 4 patch 1.10.114. It may or may not work with older versions of Fallout 4.\n<br />\n<br />[u][size=6][b]Details[/b][/size][/u]\n<br />\n<br />[b]A) How Often will I get attacked?[/b]\n<br />\n<br />In normal mode, you are safe to sleep in the daytime. The probability of being attacked at night is determined by how long you sleep and your luck:\n<br /> \n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]1 hour   : 10% chance of being attacked\n<br />[*]2 hours : 13%  chance of being attacked\n<br />[*]4 hours : 20%  chance of being attacked\n<br />[*]8 hours : 50%  chance of being attacked\n<br />[/list]\n<br />    Luck:\n<br />  [list]\n<br />[*]Poor Luck  (0 -&gt; 3) multiplies odds of getting attacked by 1.25\n<br />[*]Good Luck  (7 -&gt; 9) multiplies odds of getting attacked by 0.75\n<br />[*]Great Luck (10+)    multiplies odds of getting attacked by 0.50    \n<br />[/list]\n<br />Example:\n<br />\n<br />If you sleep for 7 hours, normally there is a 20% chance of being attacked. If your luck score is 3 or less, that increases to a 25% chance. If your luck is 10 or more, odds drop to a 10% chance. \n<br />\n<br />[b]B)  Enemies[/b]\n<br />\n<br />The number of enemies in a wave is determined by your level. After level 35,  there is a 50% chance you will get a second random wave of enemies if the first roll succeeds. IE: You might get a group of deathclaws and a group of raiders all at once. \n<br />\n<br />[b]C)  Safe Locations[/b]\n<br />\n<br />You are always 100% safe to sleep in big cities such as Diamond City, Goodneighbor, Bunker Hill, Vault 81, Far harbor, Arcadia, Nuka Town and Most Vaults. You are also generally safe to sleep in your Faction Stronghold.\n<br />\n<br />In normal mode, you are also safe to sleep in the daytime and in owned settlements. However settlements are only safe at night if their defense rating is 20 or higher. Night is considered the hours between 9:30 PM and 5:30 AM.\n<br />\n<br />In Nightmare mode, you can be attacked even in owned settlements. However, settlers may help defend the player.\n<br />\n<br />Finally, if you are attacked on a given day, you will not be attacked the next time you sleep unless you enable the option to allow multiple attacks per day. \n<br />\n<br />[size=4][u][b]Nightmare Mode[/b][/u][/size]\n<br />\n<br />Users can optionally enable Nightmare mode. In nightmare mode:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]You can be attacked anytime you sleep, day or night\n<br />[*]Basic settlements no longer offer protection. \n<br />[*]Only big cities and indoor strongholds are safe.\n<br />[*]Every 7th day, sleeping carries a 50% risk of being attacked by a Ghoul Horde\n<br />[/list]  \n<br />Ghoul Horde:\n<br />  \n<br />A ghoul horde is a sizable group of ghouls that arrive in 3 waves. Each wave is tougher than the previous. Hi-level glowing ghouls can emit a radiation burst that heals and resurrects nearby dead ghouls from earlier waves. This is what makes Ghoul Hordes particularly dangerous. One stray final boss can resurrect all 3 previous waves at once. \n<br />  \n<br />So keep an eye on your Game Day. If it is divisible by 7, find shelter or be prepared for a major battle.\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][u][b]Daydream Mode[/b][/u][/size]\n<br />\n<br />An optional mode for users who want sleepless nights to be less challenging so they don't have to reload their save games as much.   In this mode:\n<br />      [list]\n<br />[*]You can sleep up to 2 hours with 0% chance of being interrupted\n<br />[*]Sleeping for 3 or 4 hours is less risky\n<br />[*]The Max Number of Sleeps before a mandatory attack is doubled\n<br />\n<br />[*]Sleeping within the boundaries of any settlement is safe. Ownership and defense rating don't matter.\n<br />\n<br />[*]Enemies still level with the player, but the number of enemies stops increasing at level 20. \n<br />[*]No larger-than-man sized enemies. IE: No Behemoths or Deathclaws\n<br />[*]No possibility of a second wave of enemies or Ghoul Horde.\n<br />\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[i][u]Shameless Self Promotion[/u]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2]This mod was created to complement the mod [/size][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/26976]Amazing Follower Tweaks[/url][/i][size=2][i] in order to increase the value of multiple companions and a portable camp with defensive capabilities. While recommended, AFT is not needed for this mod to work.\n<br />[/i][/size]\n<br />[size=6]Usage:[/size]\n<br />[size=2]\n<br />After being installed, you will find a Misc Holotape in your inventory called \"Sleepless Nights Settings\"\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[list=1]\n<br />[*][ ] Nightmare Mode - Toggle this option on if you wish to play in nightmare mode.\n<br />[*][ ] Daydream Mode - Toggle to play in Daydream Mode\n<br />[*][ ] Allow Multiple attacks per day -  Toggle if you don't mind being attacked multiple times a day.\n<br />[*]Force Attack After [ ] Sleeps - determines max sleeps in uninhabited areas before an attack is forced.\n<br />[*]Prepare for Uninstall - Select to shut down Sleepless Nights Scripts. Recommended before disabling the mod. \n<br />[*]Tab to Exit - Reminder, but also offers a back door to the Debug Menu. Click 6 times and it changes to [Debug Menu].\n<br />[/list][center]﻿[/center]",

Being script-based, DDLL has the benefit of [b]not [/b]requiring specific DLCs and Creations, and [b]not[/b] requiring you to create or used merged patches![/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b]How does it work?\n<br />[/b][size=3]Without going [i]too[/i] technical, when you first load DDLL it will scan through your currently loaded plugins and [b]specifically[/b] look for which DLC and CreationClub plugins are enabled. If supported plugins are found, DDLL will dynamically 'fetch' relevant items, place them in DDLL's own, custom Leveled Lists, and then inject those Leveled Lists throughout the game - much like many popular weapon mods do. Best of all, this means there are [u][b]no[/b][/u] hard requirements - you could even load this mod with no DLCs or CreationClub plugins enabled at all, it just wouldn't do anything.\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[b]Customizing your experience\n<br />[/b][/size][size=3]When DDLL starts up, you'll be shown a message box that lets you tailor DDLL to your preference - namely:\n<br />[/size][list]\n<br />[*][size=2]If you want CreationClub items to inject into your game only [b]after[/b] you complete each Creation's quest (default being no.)[/size]\n<br />[/list][list]\n<br />[*][size=2]What types of Creations you want to inject into your game (See Item Tiers below)[/size]\n<br />[/list][size=3]You can re-open the Customization Menu by crafting the DDLL Customization item from a Chemistry Workbench under the Utilities section.\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[b][size=4]Item Tiers\n<br />[/size][/b][size=3]Every supported CreationClub plugin has been assigned a [b]Tier[/b] - with the Tiers being Standard, Wacky and Unhinged. \n<br />Standard items being non-surprising items in the game (The CR-74L, Anti Materiel rifle etc), Wacky being in-lore but silly items (Zetan Arsenal, Pint-Sized Slasher's knife etc), and Unhinged being non-lore items (BFG 9000, Thunderbolt etc). You can choose up to which tiers you want present in your game from the configuration menu.

From Skyrim to Fallout! Because fallout deserves immersion as well!\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]Ever wondered why [/size][/font][font=Verdana][size=3][font=Verdana][size=3]NPC's [/size][/font]always seems to have a longer pause between each sentence? Well No more, They are actually talking like people should do now.\n<br />Every social logic in Fallout for [font=Verdana][size=3]NPC's[/size][/font] is changed, they talk more often to each others. And will less likely greet to you from a distance, they will also greet less often too, making them to not act as much as robots. [font=Verdana][size=3]NPC's[/size][/font] are also more clever and will know for example if they talked to a [font=Verdana][size=3]NPC [/size][/font]and will therefore talk to another or not talk at all. After some time, they talk again with each others.\n<br />Expressions is also overhauled, they express themselves when they actually should. \n<br />Emotions is as well overhauled, You can see how the [font=Verdana][size=3]NPC's[/size][/font] face look more alive.\n<br />The time when NPC's eats is overhauled as well, now NPC's will eat at a more regular time like lunch: 12-1pm, Dinner 4-5pm. Player will comment more when skipping a dialogue and much much more!\n<br />\n<br />Additionally, I included the option to increase the amount of active NPC's at one cell. It doesn't magically add more NPC's it just makes it possible, so enjoy visiting your settlements with many NPC's or running into a battlefield with a huge amount of NPC's fighting.\n<br />\n<br />Did you accidentally run in to some stuff, and [/size][/font][font=Verdana][size=3][font=Verdana][size=3]NPC's [/size][/font]start to yell at you?\n<br />Well it won't happen as often now, It happen way too often in vanilla.\n<br />\n<br />This is a must-have mod for anyone that has sound on while playing.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][b]What it covers:[/b][/size]\n<br />[size=3]This covers all talking/singing [font=Verdana][size=3]NPC's[/size][/font] ( also new modded [font=Verdana][size=3]NPC's[/size][/font] ), no matter what language you have.\n<br />Also covers modded sentences.\n<br />[/size][size=6]\n<br />[b]Compatibility:[/b][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[/font][list]\n<br />[size=3][font=Verdana]Any mod actually. \n<br />[/font][/size][/list][font=Verdana]\n<br />[size=5][b]Savegame compatible and clean:[/b][/size]\n<br />[size=3]The mod is savegame compatible and is also safe to uninstall.\n<br />[b]This mod is completely script free.[/b][/size]\n<br />[size=5]\n<br />[b]Install:[/b][/size]\n<br />[size=3]Choose one of the Main files or one from the optional files.\n<br />Activate with your mod manager[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[/font][font=Verdana][size=4][b]My other Fallout 4 mods:[/b][/size]\n<br />[size=3][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/145/?]Fallout Texture Overhaul Stars\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/160?]Fallout Texture Overhaul Moons\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/449/?]Fallout Texture Overhaul PipBoy (Pip-Boy) UHD 4K\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/3344]Fallout Texture Overhaul Power Armors UHD 4K\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/32246]Fallout water overhaul[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/32255]Fallout Texture Overhaul Radscorpions 4K[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/32334]Fallout Texture Overhaul Mole rats 4K[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/32514]Realistic Conversations Fallout 4[/url][/size][color=#ffffff][size=3][u][b]\n<br />\n<br />[/b][/u][b][size=6][b]Permissions:[/b][/size]\n<br />[size=3]This mod is made by Gorgulla and is ONLY allowed to be uploaded by Gorgulla on either Nexusmods or Bethesda.\n<br />If you find it elsewhere, IT'S STOLEN.\n<br />You are not allowed to change my mod and upload it as your own.[/size][/b][/size][/color]\n<br />[/font]",

By default there are three nude options available that don't require anything but installation, as well as [url=http://vintagedancer.com/1950s/1950s-lingerie]lore-friendly underwear[/url] styles for these body shapes (using Beth's own unused underwear meshes).\n<br />\n<br />These meshes have a total of over 21k vertices - compared to the vanilla body's modest 1750 - for optimal smoothness. In tests there have been no reports of these high-poly meshes causing any slow down, but may still be too much for weaker systems to use, so be warned. \n<br />\n<br />Included in the main installer are bodies, textures, all vanilla and DLC outfits, and BodySlide addons for the body and outfits.\n<br />There are also morph files for the body and the outfits included, which are used for in-game morphing with [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/12631/]LooksMenu[/url] or other script mods.\n<br />\n<br />Also, in the Optional downloads, are files for the CBBE Reduced bodies. These are lower poly than the main file, but have working dismemberment.

Ensure you have entered all three lines into your .ini and all files listed in Troubleshooting are present in your game directory. Make sure the file is called Fallout4Custom.ini, not Fallout4Custom.ini.txt (un-hide file extensions)!\n<br />[color=#a0fff0]A2:[/color] If NPCs have changed, but your player character hasn't, you're using a mod that changes the directory for the player body meshes/textures, such as 'Unique Player'. You'll need to install matching meshes/textures manually.\n<br />[color=#a0fff0]A3:[/color] If your player character has changed, but NPCs haven't, you're using a mod that changes the directory for NPC body meshes/textures. You'll need to install the meshes/textures manually.\n<br />[color=#a0fff0]A4:[/color] You're not looking at a nude female adult character or are currently wearing an outfit that's not CBBE-compatible.\n<br />[color=#a0fff0]A5:[/color] Your mod manager is being buggy or there's a user error. The installer is bug free, or there would be more people reporting issues. If you're using NMM, make sure you're using the latest files from GitHub.\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][color=#ffff60]Q2:[/color] Why am I getting patchwork body textures (black shoulder, nipple on stomach or painted-on underwear)?[/size]\n<br />[color=#a0fff0]A1:[/color] You didn't follow the instructions in the installation section. Ensure you have entered all three lines into your .ini and all files listed in Troubleshooting are present in your game directory. Make sure the file is called Fallout4Custom.ini, not Fallout4Custom.ini.txt!\n<br />[color=#a0fff0]A2:[/color] You have a conflict somewhere. Make sure you don't have any other mods that affect or overwrote the body.\n<br />[color=#a0fff0]A3:[/color] You're not using a CBBE-compatible outfit or texture on a CBBE body. At the very least, you should install the vanilla outfits/default textures found in the main file's installer.\n<br />[color=#a0fff0]A4:[/color] You're using a mod that changes the directory for the body meshes/textures. You'll need to install matching meshes/textures manually.\n<br />[color=#a0fff0]A5:[/color] Elderly women are not officially supported by this mod. Install the elderly textures found [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/7432]here[/url].\n<br />[color=#a0fff0]A6:[/color] Mannequins (Contraptions DLC) are not officially supported. Try [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/15821]this mod[/url].\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][color=#ffff60]Q3:[/color] How do I fix the texture mismatch at the back of the player/NPC head?[/size]\n<br />[color=#a0fff0]A:[/color] Activate the CBBE.esp to fix it. This only works for the player character (see below for more info).\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][color=#ffff60]Q4:[/color] Why does FO4's CBBE have a plugin when Skyrim's did not?[/size]\n<br />[color=#a0fff0]A:[/color] A lot of space was wasted on the vanilla body UV map (how a texture lines up on a mesh - the 3D model), and part of the head texture (the rear) was included as part of the body texture. FO4 CBBE's UV map is almost exactly the same as Skyrim's, making it easier for modders to convert body textures over or make new ones, and filling up the wasted space. But as a result, the part of the UV map used for the head is taken up by our leg texture.  The plugin corrects this by pointing the head rear to a duplicated, vanilla body texture (femalebhed.dds). The plugin is optional if you have hair covering your head rear or can ignore the issue.\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][color=#ffff60]Q5:[/color] Why does the plugin for the head mismatch only work for the player?[/size]\n<br />[color=#a0fff0]A:[/color] Each NPC in FO4 has its own head texture -  in Skyrim, the texture was shared with the player, with only skin tone/makeup/scars/warpaint being unique to the NPC. This is why your shiny new face texture doesn't work with NPCs and why fixing the back of the head is harder than just a quick texture swap.\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][color=#ffff60]Q6:[/color] Why are some of the vanilla outfits so 'jaggy'?[/size]\n<br />[color=#a0fff0]A1:[/color] Most of the outfits are low poly because they are the vanilla outfits directly edited to work with CBBE/BodySlide. We didn't have time to remake all the outfits with a higher poly count, as it's a lot of work. A few, such as the vault suit or dresses, have been granted additional polygons.\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][color=#ffff60]Q7:[/color] Do outfits or body textures not specifically made for CBBE work with it?[/size]\n<br />[color=#a0fff0]A:[/color] Only body textures made to work with CBBE will show up correctly in all places, as CBBE has different UV maps for texture alignment. Outfits that show skin in any way need to be compatible with CBBE to match up. You'll have to (nicely) ask the creator to make a version of their mod for CBBE or convert the outfit yourself using Outfit Studio, or the textures using Photoshop/GIMP/etc.\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][color=#ffff60]Q8:[/color] Will there be a male version?[/size]\n<br />[color=#a0fff0]A:[/color] We would like to but are mostly lacking the time. Try the [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/10360]Super Hero Bodies by smorris2012[/url], which can be customized using BodySlide.\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][color=#ffff60]Q9:[/color] How do I make this player-only?[/size]\n<br />[color=#a0fff0]A:[/color] Install a mod like '[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/3718]Unique Player[/url]' and follows its instructions. Note that outfits won't be unique unless you duplicate their game entry yourself or have your player character only use standalone modded outfits. The linked unique player mod also doesn't support 1st person meshes properly, so you could get issues with the hand seams in 1st person. Better would be to install one of the default bodies for all NPCs to use, and use the in-game morphs with BodySlide and LooksMenu to make your character have her own shape (this would also mean all compatible outfits will morph to your character's shape when worn).\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][color=#ffff60]Q10:[/color] Will you put this on Bethesda.net?[/size]\n<br />[color=#a0fff0]A:[/color]  CBBE and its outfits are[url=https://bethesda.net/en/mods/fallout4/mod-detail/4061893] now on Bethesda.net.[/url]\n<br />\n<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/KhIHYTg.png[/img]\n<br />If the mod appears not to be working, the most common cause is incorrectly placed files.

[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/21497]Mod Configuration Menu[/url]﻿ is now required, as well as [url=http://f4se.silverlock.org/]F4SE[/url]﻿.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#b6d7a8]What is new[/color][/b]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]MCM support for configuration and hotkeys (to use Q change VATS hotkey in game menu first)\n<br />[*]Settings stored in ﻿[code]MCM&#92;Settings&#92;VAFS Redux.ini[/code]\n<br />[*]Fixed or replaced mechanics that didn't work\n<br />[*]Support for Perks excluded in original mod\n<br />[*]Restored chems, now one slow time won't activate while other is active\n<br />[*]Slow time from perk [i]Nerd Rage![/i] and [i]Marty's legendary armor mod[/i] dispel VAFS\n<br />[*]Weapon AP cost taken directly from equipped weapon - supports new weapons\n<br />[*]New animation for using Critical and Four Leaf Clover (like in VATS)\n<br />[*]Disabled VATS, can be activated in MCM, but mod aims to replace it\n<br />[*]VATS ability are usable outside of VATS (Awareness, VANS)\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[b][color=#b6d7a8]MCM Hotkeys[/color][/b]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]hotkeys to activate Focus and Critical are accepted only without modifier (no Shift, Ctrl, Alt)\n<br />\n<br />[*]if key is already in use by game (like Q for VATS), you need to change it in game settings or it won't work in MCM\n<br />[*]Awareness and Vans abilities are used holding hotkeys for Focus and Critical\n<br />[*]Awareness and Vans can use separated hotkey if set in MCM and will accept modifier (e.g. Shift+Q)\n<br />[*]MCM won't accept gamepad button as hotkey, you will need to use consumables or third party program to simulate keyboard press with gamepad\n<br />\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/S84ujFg.png[/img]\n<br />Focus replaces VATS with bullet time, that scales mainly with Perception. For most parts, vanilla VATS [i]accuracy[/i] is replaced with [i]slow factor[/i] (how strong will slow time be). In comparison to original mod, slow factor is lower, especialy with low Perception (can be boosted in MCM), so it's less usefull without investment, just like VATS, and to keep similar [i]\"slow time\"[/i] effect still viable. You can use addictive Jet with strong slow time or use VAFS Focus, that is limited by AP, with weaker slow time and damage penalty. Don't worry though, if you build your character around VAFS, slow time will be even stronger than Jet, and damage penalty can be adjusted or completely turned off in MCM.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#b6d7a8]Features[/color][/b]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Slow time scales with Perception, Perks, Equipments\n<br />[*]Activate/deactivate with MCM hotkey\n<br />[*]Various MCM options for AP cost, visual and sound\n<br />[*]While active drains AP/s (def. 30) and for every weapon attack\n<br />[*]Weapons uses their actual AP cost x Mult (def. 0.75 for similar values as original)\n<br />[*]While active +20% accuracy with non-auto weapons but -20% damage (configurable)\n<br />[*]Focus will deactivate when AP runs out, switching weapon or ﻿scripted slow time activates\n<br />[*]Depleting all AP with attacks stop AP regen for 2 sec\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[b][color=#b6d7a8]Perception and Slow Time[/color][/b][list]\n<br />[*]1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9/10 PER =&gt; 20/28/35/41/46/50/53/56/58/60% slow\n<br />[*]With *[i]Stronger Focus[/i] option -&gt; 40/46/52/56/60/63/65/67/69/70% slow\n<br />[*]Each PER past 10 =&gt; +1% up to max 80% at 30 PER (*up to 85%)\n<br />[*]Slow factors are multiplicative not additive\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/NK5iaup.png[/img]\n<br />Successful hit builds up Critical Meter, that can be used anytime. If used in VAFS, replenish part of AP, otherwise slows time for next attack. Fill rate increases with Luck and is lower outside of VAFS (configurable). [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/20309]HUDFramework[/url]﻿ [i]by registrator2000[/i] is required for Critical Meter widget, but works fine without it.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#b6d7a8]Features[/color][/b]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Separate critical meter outside VATS\n<br />[*]Critical fill rate increases with Luck and is lower outside VAFS (configurable)\n<br />[*]Use Critical for next attack with MCM hotkey (~3 attacks with automatic weapons)\n<br />[*]Using critical outside of VAFS will slow time by 50% for next attack\n<br />[*]Using critical in VAFS will restore AP, amount = 2x passive AP drain\n<br />[*]Various MCM options for AP cost, visual and sound\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[b][color=#b6d7a8]Widget[/color][/b]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Requires HUDFramework, otherwise disabled\n<br />[*]MCM hotkey for Config mode (change position and size while playing)\n<br />[*]Options when and how long is widget shown\n<br />[*]Position and Size\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/5CVs5Hv.png[/img]\n<br />All VATS related perks included. VAFS uses its own perks, checks if character has their vanilla counterparts and applies new effects. Some effects of original mod was modified or completely changed. DLC perks also works, but requires patch for ingame Perk Menu to be shown correctly.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#999999][i]&gt; SPECIAL Perks[/i][/color]\n<br />[b][color=#ea9999]Ironfist [/color][/b](rank 5): Using Critical with punching attack will paralyze oponent (vanilla paralyze spell)\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]Awareness [/color][/b](2): +5/10% slow and +0/10% damage in VAFS[list]\n<br />[*]Use ability with hotkey* while facing your target (range increases with Perception and scopes)\n<br />[*]Show target's Name, LVL, HP, Resistances and target hostility (red/green outline)\n<br />[*]optional Area Scan in VAFS to subtly highlight all targets\n<br />[/list][b][color=#9fc5e8]Demolition Expert[/color][/b] (rank 4) - Reduces incoming damage of all explosions in VAFS by 50%\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]Sniper [/color][/b](rank 3)﻿: +20% slow with semi-auto scoped rifles and -20% AP drain in VAFS\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]Penetrator [/color][/b](2): In VAFS gain 30/50% balistic penetration, do +15/30% energy critical damage and +0/10% damage with all ranged weapons\n<br />[b][color=#9fc5e8]Concentrated Fire[/color][/b] (3): -10/15/20% passive AP drain in VAFS[list]\n<br />[*]+5% damage for every attack on same body part up to +15/30/50%\n<br />[*]1st hit gains no extra damage (0 -&gt; 5% -&gt; 10% ...)\n<br />[*]Hit chain isn't disrupted by switching VAFS on/off\n<br />[/list][b][color=#f9cb9c]Attack Dog[/color][/b] (rank 1): +10% slow while canine companion is active\n<br />[b][color=#ffe599]VANS [/color][/b](rank 1): +5% XP, and usable ability with hotkey*\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]optional Explorer challenge: +5/10/15% speed if not in combat with holstered weapon per 50/150/300 discovered locations\n<br />[/list][b][color=#93c47d]Quick Hand[/color][/b] (rank 2): -80% passive AP drain in VAFS while reloading\n<br />[b][color=#93c47d]Blitz [/color][/b](2): In VAFS moves +100/200% faster and do +0/25% damage, while unarmed or holding melee weapon\n<br />[b][color=#93c47d]Gun Fu[/color][/b] (3): Until you exit VAFS, do +25% dmg to 2nd target/ +50% to 3rd/ always crit on 4th and beyond[list]\n<br />[*][i]Fixed -[/i] wasn't working correctly in original mod\n<br />[*][i]New [/i]- in VAFS first hit on each new target also restore some AP until targets limit is reached\n<br />[/list][b][color=#b4a7d6]Mysterious Stranger[/color][/b] (4): Successful attack in VAFS increases chance that MS appears for 6/8/10/12 sec[list]\n<br />[*]Chance increment is 10% of vanilla values, starts at 0 and grows until MS kill at least one enemy\n<br />[*]MS appear near your target and engage him with unique .44 revolver (500 dmg)\n<br />[*]MS leaves when time is up, there is no more enemies, or enter bleedout state\n<br />[/list][b][color=#b4a7d6]Critical Banker[/color][/b] (4): Increases the amount of Critical that can be hold\n<br />[b][color=#b4a7d6]Grim Reaper's Sprint[/color][/b] (3): Killing in VAFS has 15/25/35% (by default) chance to AP (by default 500 AP)\n<br />[b][color=#b4a7d6]Four Leaf Clover[/color][/b] (4): Any hit during VAFS has chance to give an extra crit charge\n<br />[b][color=#b4a7d6]Ricochet[/color][/b] (rank 3): Killing enemy with ricochet has 25% chance to fill Critical meter[list]\n<br />[*]VATS chance is disabled to prevent situation where you could get critical meter filled in one but not in other\n<br />[/list][i]\n<br />[/i][color=#999999][i]&gt; Companion Perks[/i][/color]\n<br />[b][color=#b6d7a8]Isodoped [/color][/b](Hancock): +20% critical fill rate while irradiated (+250 Rad)\n<br />[b][color=#b6d7a8]Killshot [/color][/b](MacCready): +10% slow in VAFS\n<br />\n<br />[color=#999999][i]&gt; Magazine Perks[/i][/color]\n<br />[b][color=#b6d7a8]Islander's Almanac n.2[/color][/b] (DLC): +5% critical chance in VAFS on animals you are in combat with\n<br />[size=2]\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/Whk1A5D.png[/img]\n<br />Items with VATS related effect not included in original mod are now covered.

With few exeptions, all entries and scripts are new and separated from vanilla game. Most incompatibilities comes from changed names and description. For example, Perk changing mod will work if loaded after this mod. You will loose VAFS description but both mod will work.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#b6d7a8]Vanilla Edits\n<br />[/color][/b][list]\n<br />[*]Description for Perks, Items, Stats and Loading Screen (they still keep their VATS effects)\n<br />[*]Ricochet (rank 3) chance for VATS is controled by VAFS\n<br />[*]Scripts: [i]LegendaryMagicEffectSlowTimeScript.psc [/i]and [i]PerkNerdRageSlowTimeScript.psc [/i]([url=https://i.imgur.com/3xE8dvD.jpg]code[/url])\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/sbRCxDZ.png[/img]﻿\n<br />There are 3rd person animation related issues that I won't be able to fix:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]character can't melee attack in 3rd person with Blitz perk while moving - game issue tied to move speed animation\n<br />[*]firing auto weapons in 3rd person in VAFS drain AP ~3 times - again issue with 3rd person animation\n<br />[/list]\n<br />In more details, anything that increase character move speed past certain point will couse unability to attack while moving in 3rd person. Most likely it is related to game animation that change from runing to sprinting and thus prevent character to attack, becouse there is no animation for attack while sprinting (don't have much experience in that so its all deduction from testing). For multiple cost while using automatic weapon in 3rd mode there also seems to be a little different animation in 3rd person that looks like gun is fired multiple times and after testing I am inclining to be issue of animation as well. If anyone know better about these issues I will be glad to corrected, until then I recomend to play in 1st person specificaly for those two situation.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/jO2Gmoz.png[/img]﻿\n<br />Big thanks to people, whose work made this mod possible.\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/15875]VAFS - VaultTec Accelerated Focus System - Manual Criticals and Bullet Time[/url]﻿ [i]by Ashnal[/i]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/21497]Mod Configuration Menu[/url]﻿ [i]by reg2k - Neanka - shadowslasher410[/i]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/20309]HUDFramework[/url]﻿ [i]by Registrator2000\n<br />[/i][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/6821]FOMOD Creation Tool[/url]﻿ [i]by Wenderer[/i]",

Please wait for official Fallout 4 patches.\r<br />\r<br />[b]How do I run this?\r<br />[/b]This is a standalone executable, installing via NMM will help you with update notifications, but you need to launch this program yourself manually.

There is no acceleration setting for this game.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Does this work with F4SE?\r<br />[/b]This works with any executable you want. Just go in Settings and change the executable to the program you want to use.\r<br />\r<br />[b]How do I Uninstall?\r<br />[/b]First, to revert your INI back to default, go into Settings &gt; Restore Backup INI.  If you&#39;re using this app as your default launcher, also make sure to press &#34;Click to Restore Original Launcher&#34;. Then, simply delete this program.\r<br />\r<br />[b]My terminal is broken&#33; Minigames are too fast&#33; Wierd things happening in game that shouldn&#39;t. Help&#33;\r<br />[/b]By turning off framerate lock(vsync) the game physics will become completely unreliable. Make sure to lock the framerates yourself by setting a cap (Nvidia Inspector) or turn on vsync in AMD/NVidia Control panel.\r<br />\r<br />[b]THIS IS A VIRUS&#33;&#33;&#33;111oneone\r<br />[/b]This is not a virus. I perform many tasks ranging from editng file attributes (Read Only mode), modifying the Registry (CPU Priority tweak), and accessing files in your Programs directory (Default game install directory). These actions + not being a AAA software developer, some AV products will flag my tool as potentially malicious as a CYA.\r<br />\r<br />[b]MY SAVES ARE GONE&#33;&#33;[/b]\r<br />You created a new save profile in the launcher without checking &#34;Import existing saves&#34; so you will have to manually move your saves from the Backup_Saves folder in Documents&#92;My Games&#92;Fallout 4&#92; to Documents&#92;My Games&#92;Fallout 4&#92;Profiles&#92;ProfileName&#92;\r<br />\r<br />[b]MipMap Fix is forcing my textures to Medium&#33;&#33;&#33;\r<br />[/b]The vanilla launcher isnt designed to accept custom values so it freaks out and displays an erroneous texture value. I assure you, its not setting textures to medium.\r<br />\r<br />[b]Can you add xxxx feature?\r<br />[/b]Please PM me feature requests, as its near impossible for me to keep track of feature requests in the discussions forum. \r<br />\r<br />[b]What does xxxx feature do?\r<br />[/b]Before asking this, please hover your mouse over the option to see what I wrote. 99% change if you ask me, i&#39;ll give you the exact same description as in the program.",

I mean, your going to be fighting them ALL THE TIME. This mod adds various headwear and armor in the game that appear wilder, more savage, more \"raider-esque\". Also included are consumables, new power armor, dog gear and equipment modifications, designed to reflect the savagery and carelessness of the raider faction. This mod requires the AWCKR mod, and nearly everything is CBBE compatable. Every piece included (except the raider mod armor retexture) is 100% standalone and no vanilla textures have been replaced in any way. Raiders and their dogs in your game will randomly spawn with n new or armor. You may even meet a Raider Dreadnaught up close!\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff0000][size=5]WARNING: This mod makes raiders tougher (duh)[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />If you like my Power Armor, but dont want the rest of my mod, check out [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/13552/?]Mad Max's Raider Power Armor Chop-Shop[/url]\n<br />\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/15/?]CBBE[/url] compatable.\n<br />\n<br />KKTheBeast has made [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/14182/?]VIS[/url] patches for this mod.\n<br />\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/6091/?tab=1&amp;navtag=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Ffallout4%2Fajax%2Fmoddescription%2F%3Fid%3D6091%26preview%3D&amp;pUp=1]Armor and Weapons Keyword Community Resource[/url] is required to use this mod.\n<br />\n<br />I have also included a download, [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/10962/?]Raider Armor Buff[/url] that adds a little defense to raider armor.\n<br />\n<br />There's also the [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/11853/?]Super Mutant Redux[/url]\n<br />\n<br />Dont forget there is now [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/5028/?]Better Armor Mod Descriptions[/url] support!\n<br />\n<br />Featured on [url=http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/user/6083674-haoswidasee/]Haoswidasee[/url]'s [url=http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/3642835-ultimate-fallout-4-mod-compilation-100-working-mods-with-installation-instructions/]Ultimate Fallout Mod Compilation[/url]!\n<br />\n<br />Hable Espanol: [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/15915?]Raider Overhaul WIP with Spanish Translation[/url]\n<br />[line][center][b][font=Tahoma][color=#ffd966][size=4][img]http://i67.tinypic.com/28bs5j8.png[/img][/size][/color][/font][/b][/center][list]\n<br />[*][b][font=Tahoma][color=#ffd966][size=4][/size][/color][/font][/b]\n<br />[*][font=Trebuchet MS][size=2][color=#f6b26b][/color][/size][/font]\n<br />[*][b][font=Tahoma][color=#ffd966][size=4]Weapons [/size][/color][/font][/b]\n<br />[*][font=Trebuchet MS][size=2][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/10771/?]Mad Can: Fury Beans (Can Cudgel)[/url][/size][/font]\n<br />[*][font=Trebuchet MS][size=2][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/11117/?tab=4&amp;navtag=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Ffallout4%2Fajax%2Fcomments%2F%3Fthread_id%3D3922275%26mod_id%3D11117]Crowbar[/url][/size][/font]\n<br />[*][font=Trebuchet MS][size=2][color=#f6b26b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/12102/?]Murdering Chainsaw[/url][/color][/size][/font]\n<br />[*][font=Trebuchet MS][size=2][color=#f6b26b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/11142/?]Slaughtering Buzz Axe[/url][/color][/size][/font]\n<br />[*][font=Trebuchet MS][size=2][color=#f6b26b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/16657/?]Crude Blowback[/url][/color][/size][/font]\n<br />[*][font=Trebuchet MS][size=2][color=#f6b26b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/18457/?]Handmade Revolver[/url][/color][/size][/font]\n<br />[*][font=Trebuchet MS][size=2][color=#f6b26b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/17335/?]Concrete Sledgehammer[/url][/color][/size][/font]\n<br />[*][font=Trebuchet MS][size=2][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/10826/?]Pipe [/url][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/10826/?]Shotgun [/url][/size][/font]\n<br />[*][size=2][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/11274/?]Standalone Pipe Shotgun[/url][/size]                                    \n<br />[*][font=Trebuchet MS][size=2]Chopper Pipe Rifle Mod[/size][/font]\n<br />[*][font=Trebuchet MS][size=2]H.A.T.E.

This (very) heavy Raider upgrade is one tier higher than buttressed armor. It sports impressive stats, on par with Heavy Combat Armor. The Dreadnaught set is layered in vibrant, contrasting colors to attract enemies, and bring WAR. You'll instantly know where to focus your attention, as will your enemies when your wearing this fortress of undiluted awesome! Completely compatible with all linings, renaming, and fully integrated into the game. With this set I've included a custom fitted Dreadnaught Helmet, as fearsome as it is defensive. Also there's a new outfit to compliment the set, the Tar Walker Outfit, garb peeled from the oily hands of the infamous Tar Walkers from a secluded, ruined city called Filla Delphia.[size=2]\n<br />\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[center][line]\n<br />[img]http://i65.tinypic.com/jhvggp.png[/img]\n<br />The forged have a whole new look and feel. And a big defense boost to boot. Ive added custom armors for the forged that will only spawn on them. There are 5 variants:[/center][list]\n<br />[*]Forged Subaltern Outfit\n<br />[*]Forged Factotum Outfit\n<br />[*]Forged Abettor Armor\n<br />[*]Forged Despot Armor\n<br />[*]Forged Magnate Armor\n<br />[/list]Each variant has slightly more defense and fire resistance than the previous. 3 of the outfits can be crafted in the AWKCR Armor Station, however the other 2 variants must be looted from the forged themselves. Furthermore, the forged will now spawn with crowbars and shiskebabs in addition to their flamers.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff0000] IMPORTANT[/color]: This update doesnt make the forged OP in any way, however it does make them tougher. I highly suggest you take the time to outfit the settlers at the Slog. Giving your settlers better guns and armor will give them a much easier time against the tougher Forged.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center][img]http://i67.tinypic.com/t9cny8.jpg[/img][color=#f6b26b][color=#e1e1e1][size=5][img]http://i65.tinypic.com/30ijb0g.png[/img][/size][/color][/color]\n<br />[size=2]With this mod the Raider Power Armor has gotten a complete overhaul, every power armor mod, including jetpacks, 8 new paints, each with their own benefits, full leveled list integration, so it can be found throughout the Commonwealth. It still has less defense that other PA variants, but it has a great amount of health, and can be repaired with some steel and duct tape. Expect raider bosses to battle in tricked out custom power armor rigs![/size]\n<br />[line][/center][center][img]http://i65.tinypic.com/2jfejps.png[/img][/center][img]http://i64.tinypic.com/2hhn0i1.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />The Junkyard Dog Armor(s) come in light, medium and heavy variants, all of which are much heavier than vanilla dog armor, but offer far more protection, without breaking immersion. The armor will NOT make DogMeat invincible, but it will make him more resilient. I gave them some energy resistance since the majority of the armor is metal.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff0000] IMPORTANT NOTE[/color]: this upgraded defense can make raider mongrels fairly tough, but they wont spawn with any armor at low levels and their damage output remains the same. Just be prepared if you see a raider mongrel rushing at you with this armor on.\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][color=#ffd966][b][size=3]Heavy Junkyard Dog Ar[/size][/b][b][size=3]mor[/size][/b][/color]\n<br />[/list]   [size=2]-15 Units of weight\n<br />   -60 Damage Resistance\n<br />   -30 Energy Resistance[/size][list]\n<br />[*][b][color=#ffd966][size=3]Medium Junkyard Dog Armor[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />[/list]   -10 Units of Weight\n<br />   -40 Damage Resistance\n<br />   -20 Energy Resistance[list]\n<br />[*][b][color=#ffd966][size=3]Light Junkyard Dog Armor[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />[/list]   -5 Units os Weight\n<br />   -20 Damage Resistance\n<br />   -10 Energy Resistance\n<br />[line]\n<br />\n<br />Download [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/6091/?tab=1&amp;navtag=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Ffallout4%2Fajax%2Fmoddescription%2F%3Fid%3D6091%26preview%3D&amp;pUp=1]Armor and Weapons Keyword Community Resource[/url] first.\n<br />Then download with the NMM, or you can manually install, unzip and Copy into your Data folder.

Why is it not in this build?[/color]\n<br />A: Unfortunately, I found that the mod you are talking about, seems to conflict with many mods. It was one of the primary reasons I would CTD. I have used the mod many times and never had a problem with other builds. However, when putting the mod under the microscope there is a problem. Does the author know about the problem? It's either a fatal error leading to CTD or a false flag. Without dissecting the mod, I have noway to know for sure. So, I just removed it. If you really want to use the mod, I recommend you make sure it's at the top of the load order. \n<br />\n<br />[color=#f1c232]Q: Are all the mods listed above required? [/color]\n<br />A: No. The only mods required are the ones that are listed in the requirement section under \"[color=#ff7700]Required Mods and their Load Order[/color]\" You will notice that some of the mods I require are not required by the File Header of my patch. You can remove some mods that are not tied to the file header, but by doing so, some of the edits in my patch are based on using all of my Required Mods. By not using all, you increase your risk of CTD. \n<br />\n<br />[color=#dd7e6b]Q: I loaded your required mods, started a new game and it's just sitting at the load screen.[/color]\n<br />A: Sometimes when using mods and starting a new game, Fallout 4 will sit at the load screen. The screen will be black with the green little icon doing it's business on the bottom right. Hitting enter a couple of times seems to fix this. Not sure why this works, but it seems to be a bug in Vanilla not the mods. \n<br />\n<br />[color=#c27ba0]Q: My favorite mod is not on the list[/color]\n<br />A: I went through all trending files of all time and of the last six months. I removed anything that had critical errors when put under the microscope. Then I removed all mods that had minor errors. Minor errors usually doesn't mean CTD, but, it ups the probability. I was left over with about 300 mods. I kept changing the orders around and found that some mods just don't play nice with others. I removed them and got the list above. \n<br />\n<br />[color=#76a5af][color=#ffe599]Q: I really want to use [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/4472?tab=description]True Storms[/url]. Is there a way?[/color]\n<br />[color=#efefef]A: Yes. You need to use [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/15908?tab=description]Weather Synergy[/url]. Make sure you use VividPriority. Follow their suggested load order and it will work. Giving you the best of both worlds.\n<br />\n<br />Q: [color=#00ffff]Can I use [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/2139]Fr4nsson's Light Tweaks[/url] with this build?[/color]\n<br />A: Yes, just make sure [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/2139]Fr4nsson's Light Tweaks [/url]is loaded before [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/13596]Enhanced Lights and FX[/url].\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffff00]Q: Why are some enemies just heads or invisible?[/color]\n<br />A: Most likely you are using a mod that requires[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/25] Bodyslide[/url] and you didn't build the meshes as required. You can use a search engine to find tutorials on using [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/25]Bodyslide[/url]. \n<br />[/color][color=#e06666]\n<br />Q: I prefer [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/2139]Fr4nsson's Light Tweaks[/url] over [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/13596]Enhanced Lights and FX[/url]. Is there a way to use Fr4nsson's?[/color]\n<br />[color=#efefef]A:. Yes. Load [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/2139]Fr4nsoon's Light Tweaks[/url] after [/color][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/13596][color=#efefef]Enhanced Lights and FX.[/color][/url]\n<br />\n<br />Q: Can I add mods I like[/color]\n<br />A: Sure, but I can't guarantee it will be a stable build then.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#93c47d]Q: What do you mean stable?[/color]\n<br />A: I did a speed run through to see if it crashed constantly. I would return to places that it would crash a lot and find the mods that were responsible. I removed them. I would then do a stress test spawning anything I could to see if it would CTD after awhile. If so, I would try to find the mod that might be responsible and remove it. I would load mods during a save game and see what that did. I would make sure I could at least start the main quests and important side quests. After several months of this and rebuilding the patch, this is what is left over. \n<br />\n<br />[color=#e06666]Q: Is there a certain way to install graphical mods?[/color]\n<br />This usually varies by user but I prefer manual. I don't mind my mods overwriting some hi-rez textures. I would prefer low-rez in certain places and stability, then hi-rez and CTD. To try to get the best performance per look, that's a little trickier.

However, it does not play well with others and should only use the mods that the author created patches for. I highly recommend you do a play through with Horizon. [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/21872]Sim Settlements[/url] because you don't need to use it if you want. You can still build the old fashion way or use many great features Sim Settlements has to offer. \n<br />\n<br />[color=#93c47d]Q: Anything I should know about your build?[/color]\n<br />A: Yes. Some graphical glitches, most likely due to the engine and not the mods. Fallout 4 is prone to CTD in Vanilla. Even knowing this build is for Survival game-play, I still use Quick Save manager. [url=http://enbdev.com/download_mod_fallout4.htm]ENB[/url] settings can be used. I recommend using the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/332]ENB Memory Patch[/url]. How you use [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/4640]Spring Cleaning[/url] can cause some weird graphical glitches. If you are using [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/28599]Rise of the Commonwealth[/url]. I recommend you don't use [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/4640]Spring Cleaning[/url] until after you assign a leader and you don't use it on grass. Just clutter, trees and junk. When downloading a mod that I require, always pick the non script level list version when given a choice. For compatible mods, always pick script level list version when given the choice. \n<br />\n<br />[color=#3d85c6]Q: What is the files in the brackets above?[/color]\n<br />A: Some mods install more than one esp. What's in the brackets is to let you know what other files I used besides the core file. If you don't see the esp above when you install a mod that has multiple plugins, it's because it's not necessary after you use my patch or the other esps had issues, while the core file didn't. \n<br />\n<br />Q:Does [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/12511]Conquest[/url] work with [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/21872]Sim Settlements[/url]?\n<br />A: [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/12511]Conquest[/url] and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/21872]Sim Settlements[/url] can coexist but they don't work together due to how [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/12511]Conquest[/url] is scripted. When using [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/12511]Conquest[/url], you will need to build the settlements the old fashion way. \n<br />\n<br />[color=#dd7e6b]Q: I want to use different settings then you.[/color]\n<br />A: Just rename the esp. For example, Live Action Handy - With GlowMap.esp will need to be renamed to Live Action Handy.esp\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffe599]Q: My settlers keep getting killed, this is BS.[/color] \n<br />A: I think it adds a more immersive gameplay. However, there is a workaround. You are going to need [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/18978]Forcefiled Protection[/url] which is a required mod and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/12390]The God Pistol[/url]﻿. Use the console command, \"help field 4\" and pick the Mark 7 non power armor version. Use the console command again, \"help god 4\", and get the weapon ID number. Then use the \"player.giveitem (id number) 1\" or whatever. You can mod the gun to make it even more powerful. Give your settlers the gun and forcefield. They should be unstoppable then. Don't forget to have your settlers equip the items. \n<br />\n<br />[color=#b4a7d6]Q: What is your computer build so I can better guess what textures and how many mods I should be using?[/color]\n<br />i7-2700k 3.5GHZ\n<br />32GB of Ram\n<br />Nvidia Geforce GTX 1070\n<br />Windows 10\n<br />Game is installed on a WD 10k RPM Raptor Drive\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffe599]Q: Will you be adding more mods and other patches?[/color]\n<br />A: Yes, working on another one as we speak\n<br />\n<br />[color=#e06666]Q: I've done everything you asked. Download all the mods. Have the load order similar to yours. Used you patch and still constant CTD. [/color]\n<br />A: That sucks. I don't mean to be callous but there are so many reasons for this. Your graphics setting are too high. One of the graphical packs you installed had a bad install, texture, mesh, etc... Something  that you are running in the background like a virus protection program is eating up all your memory. Or, and you know it's coming, you are using another mod that is not on the list, hell bent on using it and it's not playing well with the others but don't want to tell me, hoping I will problem solve it for you. \n<br />\n<br />[color=#b4a7d6]Q: I have a super computer! How dare you mention the above, like my graphics settings are too high. [/color]\n<br />A: Maybe your computer doesn't like me and doesn't want my patch to work on your computer. I would recommend you have a talk with your computer and get to the bottom of it! \n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ff00]Q: No, I swear, I have done everything you asked and still constant CTD. [/color]\n<br />A: When using ESP and ESM, the game can only handle 256 mods. If you installed every mod that you could that is compatible with this patch, you might have exceeded your limit. If that is not the case, try to load without my patch and see if that helps. If yes, then your load order is messed up or you just got a bad download. Re-download the patch. If none of that helped, most likely you forgot to add something to your INI file as requested by this mod and others, or you forgot to download something that is required by the mods above.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ffff]Q: Still getting CTD is there anything else I can do?[/color]\n<br />A: Yes, it's a tedious process but the best process to get rid CTD's for good, or severely limit them. You will need [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/2737]F04Edit[/url] and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/38413]The Manual[/url]. It's an older manual but the rules still apply. So, it will be helpful. You are going to clean every mod. How to clean mods is described in the manual. This must be done one by one and the last mod on the list is the one you are always cleaning. Meaning, you need to actually load each mod one by one and clean them. \n<br />\n<br />For example, you would load the game, the DLC then Mod 1. Clean mod 1, save and move on. Load the game, DLC, Mod 1 and Mod 2. Clean mod 2, save and move one. Keep doing this until all your mods have been cleaned. DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT load all your mods and then clean them all in one session. This will just create more CTD and ruin your build. \n<br />\n<br />After all this, if you are still experiencing high CTD. You just have a bad build. You can check mods for errors. Once again, the manual explains how. All problematic mods should be removed. To clean DLC or not to clean DLC, that is the question. This is personal preference. I never have, but some people swear it helps stabilize the game. Make sure you follow someone's load order or you have [url=https://boss-developers.github.io/]BOSS[/url] or [url=https://loot.github.io/]LOOT[/url] do your load order for you. Not having the right load order is one of the biggest culprits for CTD.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#cc4125]Q: Help, I removed mods and added some others and now my save game is bugging out.\n<br />[/color]Fallout 4 seems to be the worse Bethesda game when it comes to changing or even upgrading mods with a current save game. It's extremely annoying but you have two options. Open the Sim Settlement management screen. Go to Tools --&gt; Configuration Tools and then click on Rebuild Local Data. This will reset your mod scripts. After three in game days, you game has a good chance of no longer bugging out. If that doesn't work. \n<br />\n<br />If you know which mod(s) might be bugging out.

It works with Skyrim Special Edition, Skyrim Legendary Edition, Skyrim Legendary Edition + Crash Fixes, and Fallout 4.\n<br />\n<br />There are already two Very Good savegame editors out there; Save Game Script Cleaner (aka SaveTool), and Savegame Script Scalpel. I use them both and they are fantastic. They do have their problems though. Script Scalpel has a difficult UI and is a bit slow. SaveTool has quite limited filtering options. And at the time I'm writing this, neither of them can load savegames from Skyrim Special Edition or that use the new file format introduced in Crash Fixes 10. And they can't handle Fallout 4. ReSaver is intended to correct those problems while adding useful new features for cleaning saves.\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]Features[/size][b]\n<br />[/b][list]\n<br />[*]Reads and writes Skyrim SE, Skyrim LE, and Fallout 4 savefiles\n<br />[*]Reads and writes the new Crash Fixes savegame file format\n<br />[*]Displays a TONS of useful information\n<br />[*]Edits script data\n<br />[*]Terminates threads (right-click on an ActiveScript and pick \"Terminate\")\n<br />[/list][i]Mod Parsing[/i]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Reads your ESM/ESP/PEX/BSA files looking for information that will help\n<br />[*]identify which parts of the savegame are the ones that you're looking.\n<br />[*]Just pick \"Parse\" from the File menu.\n<br />[*]Works best if you use Mod Organizer.\n<br />[/list][i]Filtering\n<br />[/i][list]\n<br />[*]Filter using regex (regular expressions)\n<br />[*]Filter by plugin (right-click on a plugin)\n<br />[*]Filter by mod (right-click on a plugin)\n<br />[*]Filter to show what would be deleted by each cleaning operation\n<br />[/list][i]Cleaning[/i]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Deletes unattached script instances (in the \"Clean\" menu)\n<br />[*]Deletes undefined elements (in the \"Clean\" menu)\n<br />[*]Cleans formlists\n<br />[*]Deletes plugin data\n<br />[/list][i]Not yet implemented[/i]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Exporting and importing savegame data\n<br />[*]Cleaning of Havok data\n<br />[*]Filtering scripts with invalid data\n<br />[*]Analyzing mods managed by Nexus Mod Manager or Wrye Bash\n<br />[/list]\n<br />ReSaver is quite stable and I use it myself. I have hundreds of mods, including dozens of major quest mods. I NEED a serious save editor. That's why I wrote one. I can't promise that it's perfect. It's possible that it will ruin your savefile, hard drive, childhood, and kidneys. In other words, there is no guarantee of fitness for any particular purpose, etc. But it's pretty good.\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][b]Instructions[/b][/size]\n<br />See the Videos section on the Skyrim Special Edition page for more detailed instructions.[i]\n<br />Getting started:[/i]\n<br />[list=1]\n<br />[*]Unzip the FallrimTools archive somewhere.\n<br />[*]Double-click on ReSaver.exe.\n<br />[*]Choose your savefile.\n<br />[*]You should see a tree structure that has all of the save's script elements.\n<br />[*][b]The #1 thing that most people need is to remove script instances that are not attached to anything.[/b]\n<br />[*]Go to the \"Clean\" menu and select \"Show Unattached Instances\".

The old Targeting HUD mod is now the Targeting HUD Platform mod. It unlocks 3 new mod slots that allow you to independently apply Friend, Foe, and Corpse Recognition mods.\n<br />\n<br />The categories of what mods are available for a specific item correspond with which of these 8 categories are present on that item.\n<br />\n<br />Five, adds new color swap mods, gloves, Helmets/Hats With Hair, Under Helmet Flight Cap &amp; BOS/Sack Hoods, Nudifying Rings, Invisible Therm Optics Combat Armor, and a wide variety of wearable weapons.  Outfits are crafted at the Armorsmith bench, wearable weapons are crafted at the Weaponsmith bench.\n<br />\n<br />Six, all clothing items are moddable now and are also rename-able.\n<br />\n<br />Seven, I made this mod compatible with [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/33449]VIS-G Legendary Modifications[/url].\n<br />\n<br />Eight, for the master armorsmith/scientists out there I've implemented a new craftable set of armor called Therm Optics Combat Armor. Using stealth \n<br />technology it is now possible to create cloaked combat armor pieces. Also the chestpiece can be modded with a therm optics booster that will extend the cloaking field around the user when standing still and sneaking. There is a known bug with this: These new Therm Optic armor pieces will not automatically unequip previously worn armor, you have to do that manually. This was was the only way to do invisible armor with properly functioning mods.\n<br />\n<br />Nine, this mod is now fully compatible with [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/33383]VIS-G Item Sorting[/url].  Also to make the inventory sorting experience even better I also recommend [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/10654/?]DEF_UI by Neanka and Valdacil[/url].  It makes a bunch of UI improvements and does cool stuff like replacing sorting tags with icons.  From here on out [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/6091/?]Armor and Weapon Keywords Community Resource (AWKCR)[/url] is a required file for AE, as the ArmorKeywords.esm contains the framework to make AE compatible with VIS-G without compatibility patches.\n<br />\n<br />Ten, I optimized the slot usage for all vanilla clothing to use the minimum amount of slots necessary for things to work properly.  This was done to free up slots for use by modders for clothing and accessories.  This was set up to use the Slot Usage Standard. Revision(3/25/2016)\n<br />30 - Hair on top of head/most hats\n<br />31 - long hair/flight cap linings/under helmet/hat hoods\n<br />32 - FaceGenHead (used if your worried about the face clipping through a full face mask)\n<br />33 - Full outfits - Shoes/Boots\n<br />34 - Left Hand\n<br />35 - Right Hand\n<br />36 - Arm Add-on (Bracelets), Melee weapon on back\n<br />37 - Torso Layered Add-on (Jackets)\n<br />38 - Separate Tops (for vanilla outfits that need a second slot to show all armatures-Cage/Spike/ChildofAtom)\n<br />39 - Leg Add-on (Gun on Hip/Tights/Stockings/Vanilla outfits that need a third slot to show all armatures-ChildofAtom)\n<br />40 - Separate Pants/Shorts/Skirts\n<br />41 - Torso armor\n<br />42 - Left Arm armor\n<br />43 - Right Arm armor\n<br />44 - Left Leg armor\n<br />45 - Right Leg armor\n<br />46 - Masks that cover face/headbands/(hats/helmets/hoods meant to show all hair)\n<br />47 - Eyes (Glasses/Eyepatchs)\n<br />48 - Beard (surgical mask/lower face masks)\n<br />49 - Mouth (surgical mask/lower face masks)(toothpick/cigarette/joint/cigar/blunt/lip rings)\n<br />50 - Necklace/Scarfs\n<br />51 - Ring\n<br />54 - Backpacks/ Capes/ Cloaks\n<br />55 - Satchels\n<br />56 - Shoulder Harnesses/Bandoliers\n<br />57 - Plate Carrier/Cargo Pack Vests(front and back torso)/ Belts(utility belts/gunbelts/sword belts)/ Capes/Cloaks(alternate backup slot)\n<br />58 - Body Jewelry (piercings)/ Gun on back\n<br />61 - Off-Hand Accessories (Sword Sheath/Decorative Gun/SOS if they need a Dong slot), Exoskeletons, non-eyewear head flashlights\n<br />\n<br />Eleven, All apparel can now be worn by Nick Valentine.\n<br />\n<br />Twelve, Strong or any other future super mutant followers/settlers can wear all hats/helmets, gas masks, bandanas/masks, and glasses.\n<br />\n<br />Thirteen, Changes to vanilla Hazmat Suit and Damaged Hazmat Suit: now the armor index mod slot allows to to switch between vanilla opaque lens and transparent lens with a flight cap. I also added a craftable Hazmat Suit (w/Hair) with a transparent lens.  Changes to vanilla Hooded Cleanroom Suit: now the armor index mod slot allows to to switch between vanilla opaque lens and transparent lens.\n<br />\n<br />Fourteen, Added crafting recipes for all vanilla/DLC apparel/armor/power armor. (Weaponsmith update adds crafting recipes for all vanilla/dlc weapons and ammo. So for users of both Crafting Workbenches is redundant)\n<br />\n<br />Fifteen, Added armor bench modifications to all vanilla/DLC armors for changing armor size. (So Craftable Armor Sizes is redundant).  Added armor bench modifications to all vanilla/DLC armors for making non-helmet armor pieces invisible. (So Concealed Armors is redundant).  Added armor bench modifications to all vanilla/DLC armors for making non-helmet armor pieces appear as the other armor sizes.\n<br />\n<br />Sixteen, added scrap recipes for all apparel items so you'll get 1/2 the components required to craft an item when you scrap an unmodded item instead of the nothing or next to nothing you'd get in vanilla. \n<br />\n<br />This mod was made from scratch with [url=http://afkmods.iguanadons.net/index.php?/topic/3750-wipz-tes5edit/]FO4Edit[/url].\n<br />\n<br />Screenarchers, upload some pics of your wild style.\n<br />\n<br />List of Contributors:\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/users/1362252]wax2k[/url] - Bug Tester Extraordinaire\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/users/1570471]aarlandsun[/url] - Dark Hooded Rags\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/users/2591679]agentbrea[/url] - Undies, Black Corset, Red Battlecoat, Grey Shirt and Combat Boots, Minuteman General Garvey Style\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/users/6777035]aothfezim[/url] - Darker Leather Coat and Green Hood\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/users/3126157]Azrative[/url] - Black Army Helmet, Black Flight Helmets\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/users/2581480]BMXNinja[/url] - White Military Cap (Cream Beret)\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/users/2318622]DanteMcGee[/url] - Black Dress, Black Beret, Blue Beret, Green Beret, Red Beret, Tan Beret\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/users/1422388]dheidland[/url] - Dogmeat BoS Armors, Dogmeat Minuteman Armors\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/users/4002544]wildgravity[/url] - White Nurse Uniform\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/users/28106730]StuykGaming[/url] - Black and Red Dress, Blue Brocade Dress, Burgundy Floral Dress, Cream Leaves Dress, Navy Blue Polka Dot Dress, Peach Floral Dress, Yellow Floral Dress\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/users/546441]frogs345[/url] - v2.3 Added Gloves\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/users/29062980]nhimkoko[/url] - meshes for sniper rifle on back, pistol harness, katana belt, &amp;

If an NPC is hit with a bloatfly projectile and dies within 90 seconds there is a chance their corpse will spawn a new bloatfly. I've also increased the base damage and radiation damage of bloatfly projectiles slightly.\n<br />\n<br />This mod does not edit bloatflies directly (just it's \"weapon\") or change how the bloatfly larva syringe works so it should be compatible with most mods. Taged as an esl light mod as it is very small. Not compatible with Lunar Fallout Overhaul as this is already in that mod.\n<br />\n<br />This makes bloatflies a little more interesting as they can have much more of an impact in random encounters against other NPCs. It also means the bloatfly larva syringe can cause a cascade effect if you get lucky. You can imagine that these insects aren't just attacking but laying eggs on(in?) potential hosts. This mechanic is just a sped up interpretation of their reproductive cycle.",

                "description": "[size=3]Monitor workshop access by NPC actors and configure the automatic return of weapons, ammo and legendaries looted by them.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Install this non intrusive mod at any time in any game, as it makes no static changes to your game at all. After waking in V111 cryo or moving in the Commonwealth the player is given a regenerating [ [color=#00ff00].SKK Workshop Access Monitor [/color]] aid item for menu configuration and commands (craft replacements in the chemlab).  \n<br />\n<br />The ability for NPC actors to loot containers to upgrade weapons (based on value or dps no one really knows) and ammo during combat is hard coded into the game engine, which can become hassle if you run a lot of workshop attacks. This solution detects NPC actors accessing your player owned workshops to enforce your policy.\n<br />\n<br />Update 003 includes a central weapon stash for settler returns &amp; upgrades, with access activators which can be crafted (furniture/containers) at each workshop. If one is present, settlers will use the central stash rather than the workshop to return and upgrade weapons when commanded. [i][b][color=#00ff00]This means you can still manage upgrades when access to the workshop is blocked.[/color][/b][/i]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]Menu Options\n<br />[/b]\n<br />(1) Open all workshop actor and follower inventories [ go ]\n<br />\n<br />(2) Return all weapons/ammo &amp; upgrade to the best [ go ]\n<br />\n<br />(3) Include active Followers in return all weapons [[color=#00ff00] *OFF[/color] | ON ] \n<br />\n<br />(4) Workshop Monitor [ [color=#00ff00]*Enable[/color] | Disable ] \n<br />\n<br />(5) Take weapons [ [color=#00ff00]*Enable [/color]| Disable ] \n<br />\n<br />(6) Return excess ammo  [ [color=#00ff00]*Enable[/color] | Disable ] \n<br />\n<br />(7) Legendary warning   [[color=#00ff00] *Enable[/color] | Disable ] \n<br />\n<br />(8) Wasteland Justice [ Enable |[color=#00ff00] *Disable [/color]] \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]Menu Option Details [/b]\n<br />\n<br />(1) [[color=#00ff00] Open all actor inventories [/color]] will open in sequence all player followers and local workshop assigned actors to find any other theaving. Companions (active and dismissed) are the WORST for grabbing and keeping extra weapons and ammo from corpses and containers during combat.\n<br />\n<br />(2) When in an owned workshop location the [ [color=#00ff00]Return all weapons/ammo &amp; upgrade to best[/color] ] option will transfer any droppable base game/DLC weapon and ammo from organic humanoid (Human, Ghoul, Synth, Supermutant) workshop actors and player followers to the local workshop (if workshop access is allowed) or central stash (if a local activator is built). Actors that do not have a recognised weapon or have animations for regular weapons are excluded (Alien, Robots &amp; etc). Supermutants can only use Pipe, Assault, Hunting and Minigun weapons. \n<br />\n<br />(3) Companion actors are never included in the automatic upgrade process to avoid their undroppable/inventory invisible default weapon from being removed and lost forever.\n<br />\n<br />(4) The active workshop monitor must be enabled enabled to unlok the following functions: \n<br />\n<br />(5) Block weapons &amp; ammo being taken. This will not help with actors scavenging wepons off the ground or looting corpses during combat, but [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/34693]Combat Settlers[/url]﻿ can manage that battlefield scavenging, fully compatible with this monitor for total loot coverage. If Combat Settlers is installed and its Mange Weapons function is enabled, this Take Weapons is LOCKED enabled/allowed.\n<br />\n<br />(6) If not allowed to take weapons, still return excess ammo (because actors always take the whole stack) except the 1 round they actually need. \n<br />\n<br />(7) If allowed to take weapons, warn if a legendary has been taken and optionally pop the actor inventory to retrieve it. This does not automatically return legendary weapons to avoid blocking loops where actors are allowed to upgrade weapons from the workshop, but keep trying to take the same highest value legendary that keeps getting returned. \n<br />\n<br />(8) With update 002 if actors are not allowed to take weapons, Wastleand Justice can be enforced. Any workshop thief that is not a quest target, unique or a companion actor is kicked from the workshop, made mortal and hostile. Sort them out. Check the corpse for stolen loot to clear the holding marker so it can be cleaned up.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]Known Issues[/b]\n<br />\n<br />(1) The automatic [ [color=#00ff00]Return all weapons/ammo[/color] ... ] functions can occasionally trigger actors to reset to their default ActorBase outfit if you have equipped non standard clothes/armor. This outfit reset is a base game defect triggered by script functions RemoveItem(Weapon), AddItem(Weapon) and comically EquipItem(Armor) when trying to fix the issue by automatically re-equipping armor. Even the official high quality supported Creation Club content has this problem.\n<br />\n<br />(2) Best weapon is defined in the priority order of FormList [font=Courier New]SKK_WAMWeaponListUpgrade [/font]which can be editied before a game starts, but not once a game is running as DLC weapons are automatically added to the top of the list which will be lost.\n<br />\n<br />(3) This automatically includes most DLC weapons/ammo if installed, but clearly does not know about your mod added weapons/ammo. They can be added to [font=Courier New]SKK_WAMWeaponListUser and [font=Courier New]SKK_WAMAmmoListUser [/font][/font]with xEdit at any time (best to save an an over-ride file) to be included in the main lists. Once added DO NOT REMOVE ENTRIES as this will corrupt the lists with NULL holes. \n<br />\n<br />(4) Grenades and particularly mines are excluded from the weapons lists as they can cause problems with scripted interactions. If you are feeling lucky you can try adding them to [font=Courier New]SKK_WAMWeaponListUser[/font] and see what happens. Boom.\n<br />\n<br />[b]\n<br />Compatibility[/b]\n<br />\n<br />The mod has no dependencies on extenders or DLCs and does not change any existing base game scripts, assets or objects. It is 100% pure new Creation Kit forms and scripts which means that it has no load order dependencies.\n<br />\n<br />As this mod was published after November 2019 it depends on Fallout4.exe 1.10.162.0 (or later). \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]Nexus PC manual installation &amp; disable[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Copy SKKWorkshopAccessMonitor.esp and  SKKWorkshopAccessMonitor – Main.BA2 to your...&#92;Fallout 4&#92;Data directory and add to Plugins.txt, or enable in the Bethesda mod menu, use a mod manger or however you organise. \n<br />\n<br />If [ [color=#00ff00]Workshop Monitor Disable [/color]] is set in the menu no scripts will be active so the mod can be disabled in the load order if you have removed any built weapons stash activators. Only remove mods if you are happy to accept potential conflicts from load order changes in a save game.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]Nexus FAQ[/b]\n<br />\n<br />(1) But I can stop settlers taking my stuff with seperate non accessible/locked containers or keeping all my stuff in workshops with no settlers ! Absolutley if you actually enjoy that stuff micromanagement then keep on fiddling. Clearly this QOL solution was not created for you, try Fallout 76 which contains 101% maintenance grind and inventory micromanagement.\n<br />\n<br />(2) But I am using your allegedly settler proof Global Stash ! When the player is building all the global stash inventory is transferred to the local workshop, so settlers CAN infact get their grubby little paws on your sweet sweet stuff if there is any combat whilst you are building. \n<br />\n<br />(3) Why is there no ESL version ? Because life already contains sufficient hassle maintaining 50 scripted ESP solutions. \n<br />\n<br />(4) Will this be merged the other mainstream SKK workshop/settler solutions like Workshop Ownership Utilities or Combat Settlers to reduce mod slots ? Possibly.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]Console Configuration for default settings[/b][/size]\n<br />[font=Courier New][size=2]\n<br />set SKK_WAMEnableMonitor    to 1 ;[0|1] disable | enable.\n<br />set SKK_WAMAllowWeapons     to 1; [0|1] disable | enable.\n<br />set SKK_WAMReturnAmmo       to 1; [0|1] disable | enable.\n<br />set SKK_WAMLegendaryWarning to 1; [0|1] disable | enable.\n<br />set SLL_WAMIncludeFollowers to 0; [0|1] disable | enable.\n<br />set SKK_WAMWastelandJustice to 0; [0|1] disable | enable.\n<br />\n<br />cqf SKK_WAMQuest \"SKK_WAMQuestScript.RegisterWorkshops\" ; Function to implement changes \n<br />[/size][/font][font=Courier New][size=2]\n<br />cqf SKK_WAMQuest \"SKK_WAMQuestScript.OpenInventories\" 8DigitWorkshopREF  \n<br />cqf SKK_WAMQuest \"SKK_WAMQuestScript.ReturnWeapons\" 8DigitWorkshopREF [/size][/font]",

You don't need this unless a mod specifically says you require this. There is no benefit to having this for no reason. At the time of writing this you only need it if you use [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/33947]PrivateProfileRedirector F4[/url] or [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/47359]Buffout 4[/url]. There is no other reason to use this at all. It allows the mod to make edit to game code before the game has any chance to run that code.\n<br />\n<br />[b]How does it work?[/b]\n<br />Library [font=Courier New]IpHlpAPI.dll[/font] is loaded by game automatically, which preloads the plugins, then redirects all function calls to the original [font=Courier New]IpHlpAPI.dll[/font] file in your system directory.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Installation[/b]\n<br />Put [font=Courier New]IpHlpAPI.dll[/font] and [font=Courier New]xSE PluginPreloader.xml[/font] in your root Fallout 4 directory (where [font=Courier New]Fallout4.exe[/font] is), NOT in the Data folder.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Uninstallation[/b]\n<br />Delete installed files from your game folder. Any mod that depends on this will cease to work correctly.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Configuration\n<br />[/b]Preloader is implemented as proxy to [font=Courier New]IpHlpAPI.dll[/font] and thus is incompatible with any mod that changes this DLL (none I found). In such case you need to rename another mod [font=Courier New]IpHlpAPI.dll[/font] to something else and specify new real DLL in [font=Courier New]xSE PluginPreloader.xml[/font] file. Refer to the XML file for more detailed instructions.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff0000][size=6][b]ATTENTION![/b][/size][/color]\n<br />[size=5]Go to the [font=Courier New]xSE PluginPreloader.xml[/font] file and change the load method to [font=Courier New]OnThreadAttach[/font] or [/size][font=Courier New][size=5]ImportAddressHook[/size][/font][size=5] if the default doesn't work.\n<br />\n<br />- If you're using [b]Mod Organizer 2[/b] you [i]probably[/i] need to use [/size][font=Courier New][size=5]OnThreadAttach[/size][/font][size=5] (was called \"delayed\" before v0.2).\n<br />- If you're using [b]Vortex[/b] to install mods use [b]Injector[/b] install method ([b]DINPUT[/b] for older Vortex versions).\n<br />\n<br />To change the load method, edit the value of the \"Name\" attribute in the XML file.[/size]\n<br />[code]&lt;LoadMethod Name=\"OnProcessAttach\"&gt;\n<br />    ...\n<br />&lt;/LoadMethod&gt;\n<br />[/code]\n<br />[size=5]For example, if you need to set it to \"OnThreadAttach\" or \"[/size]ImportAddressHook[size=5]\" edit this section like this.[/size]\n<br />[code]\n<br />&lt;LoadMethod Name=\"OnThreadAttach\"&gt;\n<br />    ...\n<br />&lt;/LoadMethod&gt;\n<br />[/code][code]﻿&lt;LoadMethod Name=\"ImportAddressHook\"&gt;\n<br />    ...\n<br />&lt;/LoadMethod&gt;[/code]\n<br />[b]User Q&amp;A[/b]\n<br />Q: Does this have a performance hit or any downsides?\n<br />A: Nothing that have been noticed.\n<br />\n<br />Q: Is it compatible with ENB?\n<br />A: Yes.\n<br />\n<br />Q: Is ENB required?\n<br />A: No.\n<br />\n<br />Q: Doesn't it mess up things if you load F4SE plugins at different time?\n<br />A: Only F4SE plugins that have included a special file, indicating that they wish to load earlier, will be preloaded. You should not manually create the file. Plugin author will decide this and include the file with their mod if it must be loaded like that.\n<br />\n<br />Q: I'm having issues where a plugin is not preloaded when it's supposed to!\n<br />A: Find file [font=Courier New]xSE PluginPreloader.log[/font] in your game directory and upload it with your issue report. I'll try to find out what's wrong.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Mod author Q&amp;A[/b]\n<br />Q: How do I make my plugin load before game initializes?\n<br />A: Let's say your plugin name is [font=Courier New]MyPlugin.dll[/font] and it's in Data/F4SE/Plugins, then you create a text file called [font=Courier New]MyPlugin_preload.txt[/font] in [font=Courier New]Data/F4SE/Plugins[/font], [b]the contents of the file does [i]not[/i] matter[/b].\n<br />\n<br />Q: How is the plugin loaded?\n<br />A: The [font=Courier New]IpHlpAPI.dll [/font]loader will call [font=Courier New]LoadLibrary [/font]on your plugin before game initializes. It does NOT call [font=Courier New]F4SEPlugin_Query[/font] or [font=Courier New]F4SEPlugin_Load[/font], those are called later by the F4SE itself. That means you must do whatever it is you need to do before the game initializes in your [font=Courier New]DllMain[/font] method. You can also export a function with name [font=Courier New]Initialize[/font] (with signature [font=Courier New][color=#6d9eeb]void[/color]([color=#6d9eeb]__cdecl[/color]*)([color=#6d9eeb]void[/color])[/font], i.e. no parameters, no return value, C calling convention) to be called after.\n<br />\n<br />Q: F4SE later calls [font=Courier New]LoadLibrary[/font] again, is that a problem?\n<br />A: No, [font=Courier New]LoadLibrary[/font] can be called multiple times and will only load the DLL once, unless it's in multiple locations as different files.\n<br />\n<br />Q: Can I install my plugin files (including the _preload.txt) via Mod Organizer/Wrye Bash?\n<br />A: Original SKSE Plugin Preloader page says that you can. Considering that plugin packaging is identical, I think it's applicable. Same with Wrye Bash:\n<br />be sure to tell users to choose \"Override Skips\" on the installer so that the .txt installs along with your F4SE plugin\n<br />\n<br />Plugin source is available on [url=https://github.com/KerberX/xSE-PluginPreloader]GitHub[/url].\n<br />\n<br />Credits:\n<br />Nukem - Detours library\n<br />meh321 - description template\n<br />Augh - testing.",

But as its condition [color=#ff7700]degrades[/color], so does its protection. A completely banged-up suit of Scarcity armor will protect you less than Vanilla PA.\n<br />\n<br />And it will cost you more to repair.\n<br /> \n<br />You can no longer fix the most advanced infantry weapon ever created by [color=#fce5cd]slapping 4 tin cans together[/color]. \n<br />Instead of \"4 steel,\" [color=#ffd700]repair requirements have been made meaningful[/color], using better components.[/size]\n<br /> \n<br />[color=#ffffff][size=5]Power Armor will protect you well - as long as you maintain it well.\n<br />And maintaining it will no longer be trivial.[/size][/color]\n<br /> \n<br />[size=3]For example: if [b]any[/b] piece goes [color=#ff0000]red[/color], then the suit's seals are broken, you get a warning alarm, and you lose the poison/acid immunity (along with the decreased damage resistance). Thusly:[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[youtube]DqJyeQXYEnU[/youtube] [img=right]http://i.imgur.com/lYM54vj.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />Oh, and... yes, NPCs get the added protection as well.

[color=#00ff00]Compatible with loot-changing mods and overhauls[/color]. \n<br />Random Fusion Core changes are kept.\n<br />\n<br />or\n<br />[color=#00ffff]Full version[/color] with extensive changes to leveled lists, requiring higher levels for better loot.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]The PA-Only version's Fusion Core changes edits a single record of \"what kind of FC just dropped?\" and is therefore safe with any other Loot mod - FROST, Horizon, whathaveyou. Put the PA version after any overhaul; it only modifies Vanilla Power Armor and the Fusion Core drops, so putting it second ensures the FC change carries over. Horizon has its own version of the random charge effect; but you'll need mine second to get PA changes. Let me know if Horizon's function is vastly different.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2]Technical note: it doesn't touch anything that [i][b]calls [/b][/i]for an FC drop. No containers, NPC lists, etc. Only the single form that determines what you get when you win a Fusion Core. So, if your overhaul makes FCs extremely rare - then not only will they be extremely rare, but they'll drop with a random charge. \n<br />Good luck![/size]\n<br />\n<br />[i][color=#00ff00][size=5]The following additional changes are in the Full Version:[/size][/color][/i]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ffff][size=5]Significant changes to item drop rates and level thresholds.[/size][/color]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][size=3][b]As with the PA-Only version, Fusion Cores are far more rare[/b], and when they are found, [b]they probably won't be at 100%.[/b] A variety of charge levels will be found, from nearly-depleted on up.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Ammunition is less plentiful.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Stimpacks, bobby pins, purified water, and antibiotics are less likely to be found in containers.[/size]\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[color=#00ffff][size=5]Weapon tech levels are greatly spaced out.[/size][/color]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][size=3]You will need to be higher level before seeing the better weapons.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]You might actually want to upgrade that double-barrel...[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Your fully-modded pipe gun will be your best friend for a while.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Finally finding a new weapon will feel like the major boost in power that it should.[/size]\n<br />[/list][size=3]\n<br />[/size]and in keeping with more of a sparse, scrounging or solo play style,\n<br />[color=#00ffff][size=5]Crafting station requirements have been altered to [/size][/color][color=#1e84cc][size=5]make some damn sense[/size][/color][color=#00ffff][size=5].[/size][/color]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][size=3]You no longer need to be an accomplished politician in order to bang a hammer on a table, or [color=#ff0000]light a freakin' fire[/color][/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Weapons workbench?

There's just no other way to do it.

Just make sure they come after Scarcity.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Anything else that also alters leveled lists for weapons, ammo, loot in boxes, etc., will conflict.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Anything that alters [b][color=#00ffff]vanilla [/color][/b]Power Armor will conflict. Things like Worsin's Garage, that adds stuff or alters paint mechanics, are fine. (The acrobatics I used to get the PA destruction to work is ridiculous, and now every piece of Vanilla PA has a script attached to it.)[/size]\n<br />[/list][size=3]\n<br />[color=#ff7700]There is a PA-Only version in the installer that does not have all the list changes, which should make it compatible with all the various loot overhauls and total (non-PA) conversions.[/color]\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[size=6][color=#00ffff]WHAT I [/color][color=#ff0000]DIDN'T [/color][color=#00ffff]MESS WITH: Unique PA pieces[/color] [/size]\n<br />[size=3] \n<br />The Piezoelectric, the Tesla pieces from Automatron - they're left alone. They won't get destroyed; they will still become the silly 0-health phantom item in your inventory. As there's no way you could get them back outside of console commands, the mod is being released in safe-mode. If any masochists out there want a patch that will let the unique or named pieces get wrecked too, let me know.\n<br /> \n<br />I recommend using this on a new playthrough, to get the full effect of the changes to loot and weapon upgrades.\n<br />For an existing game: if you are wearing PA in your savegame, EXIT YOUR ARMOR, make a new save, and THEN activate this mod.

Will attach to tents, or can be placed on the ground and won't fall over.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2][b]GPS Beacon:[/b] Drop this at your campsite to put a map marker in your Pip-Boy map so you can use it as a base.  Can be used anywhere.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2][b]All items have Workshop equivalents (optional ESP) [/b]so you can make these items at your settlements.  Tents/Sleeping bags are under Furniture&gt;Beds.  Dog Beds, Cloth Walls are under Decorations&gt;Misc.  Campfires and Lanterns are under Power&gt;Lights.  Tents count as single or double beds in your Settlement stats, and fires made at settlements burn forever.[/size]\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[b][color=#6fa8dc][size=3][u]HOW TO:[/u][/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][size=2][b]WATCH THE VIDEO. I guarantee you your question is answered there.  It's really short.[/b][/size]\n<br />[*][size=2][b]Grab the Adventures in Camping book from the Root Cellar in Sanctuary, so you can craft all the colors!  [/b]If you don't have the book in your inventory, you will only see the standard white/tan options.  I did this to keep crafting/workshop menus from being cluttered but I'm open to feedback here.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2][b]Craft the items you'd like to bring with you at the Chem Station. [/b]You need to craft carry-able versions that are separate from the Workshop tents.  They will be in your inventory as \"Camping Kit - [item]\".  Fires will burn out after several hours so craft a few extra![/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]When it's time to settle down and camp, look for a flat area; furniture doesn't like to work at steep angles.  There's always flat ground somewhere nearby, even the middle of the street![/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]Stand where you'd like an item placed, and drop it from your inventory.  It will place directly in front of you.  Set up your camp how you'd like.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]When interacting with the items, you will receive a menu, the first option always being that item's default action.  For example, Sleeping Bags will give you the option to \"Sleep\" or \"Pick Up\", which will put it back into your inventory.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]Each item has a MOVE and ROTATE sub-menu, that will let you nudge and rotate objects if you'd like better positioning.  It's obviously not as good as the Workshop system, but it's better than nothing.  Sometimes simply picking up and dropping the item again is the best way to move it.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2][b]TENTS[/b]: If you have a lantern in your inventory Tents will show the option to Attach/Detach Lantern.  This will automatically hang it inside of the tent, giving you a soft, dim light.  Can be removed, and if the tent is picked up, the latern will also return to your inventory.  Followers can be told to sleep in the tent and will sleep with you.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2][b]FIRES[/b]: Placed fires will burn for 4 hours. You can activate the fire and re-light it using another fire kit.  If you have a cooking pot in your inventory, you will be shown the option to attach it to the fire to cook.  NPCs and companions will sit by the fire, and as the player you will see a RELAX option, which will give you three options: sit, warm hands, warm hands kneeling.  The vanilla camera does not adjust for these animations, so it's best so zoom out in third person all the way when using.  Once you are performing the idle, you can WAIT like a regular chair, or press any key to get up.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2][b]COOKING POT[/b]: Requires a lit campfire.  If the fire dies out, the cooking pot will no longer work, asking you to re-light the fire with another kit.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2][b]DOG BED[/b]: I'm very happy with this one. Tell dog meat to lie down and he will SLEEP.  Unused animation, head-tracking is disabled so it's not creepy, and he will SNORE quietly so he doesn't seem dead (lol.)  Simply command him to follow or do something else to wake him up![/size]\n<br />[*][size=2][b]PET DOGMEAT[/b]!  If you activate the bed, you have an option to pet Dogmeat if he's close enough.  There's a 50/50 chance your male or female character will also say \"Good dog!\" or \"Good boy!\"[/size]\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />[u][b][color=#6fa8dc][size=3][u]WORKSHOP OBJECTS:[/u][/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[/u]Most of the objects have Workshop equivalents, so you can actually decorate your settlement with tents that count as beds, and use the new sleeping bags.  I needed to keep these using vanilla keywords to avoid any incompatibilities or keyword limits, so you can find them in the following:\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][size=2][b]SLEEPING BAGS / TENTS [/b]are under Furniture &gt; Beds[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2][b]CLOTH WALLS [/b]are under Decorations &gt; Misc[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2][b]DOG BEDS[/b] are under Decorations &gt; Misc (I kept them where the Dog House is)[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2][b]FIRES[/b] are under Power &gt; Lights[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2][b]LANTERNS [/b]are under Power &gt; Lights[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2][b]COOKING POT[/b] is under Crafting (workshop version works without a fire, what're ya gonna do.)[/size]\n<br />[/list]\n<br />Tents have lanterns built-in, and when activated you can toggle them on/off.  Settlers won't automatically hang out at fires, because there are so many mods that add mats for idles, it's more flexible that way, IMO.  Fires stay on forever, and don't have any menu options (I may add back in the \"Relax\" for the player though.)\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#00ff00][size=3][u]F.A.Q.[/u][/size]\n<br />[/color][/b]\n<br />[b][color=#cfe2f3]Q: Does this effect performance?  Is it script-heavy?\n<br />[/color][/b]A: No, all scripts are very tiny and are event-based.  This does not have any heavily-scripted systems, just little 'snippets' required to turn inventory items into furniture, etc.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#cfe2f3]Q: Can you use the Workshop positioning/placement system?[/color][/b]\n<br />A: I've done some deep experiments, and there are some risky issues with doing this, so no.  At least, not yet ;)\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#cfe2f3]Q: Why can't I craft fire kits in the wild just using wood?[/color][/b]\n<br />A: I wanted to keep this mod very simple. Full Workshops don't work well out in the wild, and long, complex workarounds are required in order to 'scrap' inventory items into their base components.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#cfe2f3]Q: Why didn't I read the description?[/color][/b]\n<br />A: You tell me!",

                "description": "[b][color=#ff7700]Note: Something about the 1.10 update of Fallout 4 seems to have broken this mod. As far as I can tell, the code is still fine, but the changes this mod makes to settlers to make them more amenable to having their outfits replaced aren&#39;t carrying over. I&#39;m not sure why there haven&#39;t been more reports of it not working, but I&#39;m looking into it and will post a fix as soon as I figure out what&#39;s going on.[/color]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Central Settlement Armory[/b] lets you craft armory containers at your settlements that can be used to automatically distribute armor, weapons and grenades among your settlers. In addition to two styles of basic armory container (metal box and vault locker), it also lets you craft an Armory Telestorage Manager that connects all of your settlement armory containers via teleportation, letting you distribute weapons to all connected settlements at once. This happens more quickly than I would have imagined (right now I&#39;ve got it distributing to 118 settlers in about a minute).\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#e69138][size=3]How To[/size][/color][/b]\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000]Warning:[/color] Distributing weapons to settlers will cause them to revert to their original outfits. Distribute weapons first, then distribute armor (luckily distributing armor doesn&#39;t interfere with their currently equipped weapon.)\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff7700][b]Via Settlement Armory Containers[/b][/color] \r<br />\r<br />[list=1]\r<br />[*]Craft an armory container at a settlement (found under Resources/Miscellaneous). There are two styles (metal box and vault locker) and two types (one for armor, one for weapons).\r<br />\r<br />[*]Fill the armory container with weapons or armor, depending on type.[color=#e69138]*[/color]\r<br />\r<br />[*]Retrieve obsolete weapons/armor from settlers (optional).\r<br />\r<br />[*]Check stock to see if you have enough equipment for all of your settlers (optional).\r<br />\r<br />[*]Distribute to settlers.\r<br />\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[color=#e69138][b]Via Armory Telestorage Manager[/b][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[list=1]\r<br />[*]Craft an armory weapon and/or armor container.\r<br />\r<br />[*]Craft an Armory Telestorage Manager (found under Resources/Miscellaneous, requires Level 1 Science and a Synth Relay Grenade, or Level 3 Science, to craft).\r<br />\r<br />[*]Fill armory telestorage with weapons or armor via the armory container (all gear will be moved from individual armory containers to armory telestorage upon crafting an Armory Telestorage Manager, so you don&#39;t need to hunt them all down.)\r<br />\r<br />[*]Retrieve obsolete gear from settlers (optional).\r<br />\r<br />[*]Check stock to see if you have enough gear for all of your settlers (optional).\r<br />\r<br />[*]Distribute weapons to all settlers via the Armory Telestorage Manager (this may take a minute, but progress can be checked by activating the Armory Telestorage Manager).\r<br />\r<br />[/list]\r<br />[color=#e69138]*Note: Correct armor distribution requires that armors components be placed into the appropriate sub-containers. There is a sorting function that uses AWKCR keywords to sort armors (just fill up any equipment subcontainer with armor and choose &#34;Sort Armor&#34;), but armor that lacks the appropriate keywords will be moved to junk upon sorting. Unsupported armors can be placed into the appropriate sub-containers by hand, though armors will automatically be re-sorted when &#34;Retrieve Settler Armor to Equipment&#34; or &#34;Retrieve Armor from Workbench&#34; options are chosen.[/color] \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#e69138][size=3]How It Works\r<br />[/size][/color][/b]\r<br />Central Settlement Armory steps through all of the settlers in your settlement, or all connected settlements, retrieving weapons and ammo from their inventory and moving them to junk storage. It then selects a weapon from the armory container, more or less at random, and equips it on the settler, also supplying one of the appropriate ammunition ([url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ainj6UqI0Os]this will give them infinite ammo for that weapon[/url]). \r<br />\r<br />Two storage compartments are supplied with each armory container, &#34;Equipment&#34; and &#34;Junk&#34;. Obsolete weapons recovered from settlers are moved to &#34;Junk&#34; for you to sort through and reuse if desired. New weapons are selected from &#34;Equipment&#34; and distributed among the settlers. Once an Armory Telestorage Manager is created, all armory containers will share storage, making all items accessible from any settlement.\r<br />\r<br />You can retrieve weapons and grenades from your settlers ahead of time so that you can go through their equipped gear and decide to reuse it or weed out the crummy weapons. Weapons can be retrieved to either &#34;Equipment&#34; or &#34;Junk&#34;, depending on whether you think you&#39;ll be reusing them or scrapping them.\r<br />\r<br />I&#39;ve tested this with about [s]6 connected settlements, for a total of 118 settlers[/s] 34 connected settlements with 300+ settlers, and it takes a couple of minutes to distribute the gear. It will take longer the more settlements and settlers you have, but progress can be checked by activating the Armory Telestorage Manager during distribution.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Version 2.0 adds in armor distribution. It works the same as weapon distribution, but has a container for each armor slot (clothing, one piece armor sets, underarmor, helmets, chest pieces, left arm, right arm, left leg, right leg). The mod distributes one piece armor sets first, then underarmor plus its associated armor components, then clothing. You can sort armor into these containers by hand, or use the included armor sorting functionality (it uses AWKCR keywords for the sorting, so if you want to distribute armors that aren&#39;t supported by AWKCR you&#39;ll need to sort them by hand.)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Version 2.1 adds flags to settlers that indicate that armor or weapons have been distributed to them. This means that you can redistribute periodically to get gear to any new settlers that have shown up since the last time you distributed, without having to redo your whole distribution. The flags are cleared when you retrieve armor and/or weapons from your settlers. \r<br />\r<br />In a future release, this will optionally be done automatically, keeping your settlements equipped as they grow. \r<br />\r<br />Note that this flag is new, so if you&#39;re updating from a version prior to 2.1, and have already distributed weapons and armor, you&#39;ll need to use the &#34;Flag Settlers as Equipped&#34; option at an Armory Telestorage Manager to set the flags for your equipped settlers. This only needs to be done once (the option disappears after it&#39;s been applied.)\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />Version 3.0 adds settler categorization. There are now two sets of containers each for armor and weapons, combatant and non-combatant. Categorize settlers as either combatants (usually guards, provisioners, and scavengers), non-combatants (e.g. farmers and merchants), or &#34;ignored&#34; (unassigned settlers) at armory containers, and gear will be distributed from their associated containers. This lets you do things like distribute better gear to guards, skip over unassigned settlers until you can give them a role, or narrow down your list of settlers to distribute to if you don&#39;t have enough gear for everyone.\r<br />\r<br />It also changes the behavior of Armor Telestorage Managers. Prior to version 3.0, you also needed to construct armory containers in any settlements that you wanted to distribute gear to, but now you can distribute to all settlements simultaneously.\r<br />\r<br />To avoid issues related to settler default outfits, this mod operates on generic unnamed settlers only, switching their outfits to leveled list inventory entries, forcing them to be equipped via a spell that sorts through their inventory re-equipping armor when necessary. Compatibility patches for Better Settlers are provided in the optional files section.\r<br />\r<br />Also new to version 3.0 is the ability to distribute to children (disabled unless you download the Equippable Children optional file, since there normally isn&#39;t any clothing available for them unless you&#39;ve downloaded a mod for it.)\r<br />\r<br />One-piece female-only armor can be placed in the Female armor container, and will be distributed to female settlers first. \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#e69138][size=3]Wish List/To Do[/size][/color][/b]\r<br />\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*][s]Get this working for armor as well as weapons (currently there is no easy way to get the biped slot of a piece of armor, making it impractical.)[/s]\r<br />[*]Prioritize based on weapon damage (currently the F4SE functions for checking damage and rate of fire are working too sporadically.)\r<br />[*][s]Prioritize weaponry based on settler role (distribute better weapons to guards and provisioners first).[/s]\r<br />[*]Add more styles of basic armory containers (upon request).\r<br />[*]Maybe come up with a fancier model for the basic armory, like [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/17826/?]this one[/url].\r<br />[*]Automatically poll for new settlers and distribute armor and weapons to them (optionally, since the scripts would need to run continuously and some people don&#39;t like that.)\r<br />[/list]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#e69138][size=3]Installation[/size][/color][/b]\r<br />\r<br />Install [url=http://f4se.silverlock.org/]F4SE[/url].

Install prior to installing CSA.\r<br />\r<br />Install via NMM, or manually copy Central Settlement Armory.esp and Central Settlement Armory - Main.ba2 to your data directory and tick the .esp in your load order.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#e69138][size=3]Uninstallation[/size][/color][/b]\r<br />\r<br />Remove everything from armory storage before uninstalling or your items will be lost. It&#39;s more easily done after you&#39;ve created an Armory Telestorage Manager since everything will be in central storage rather than spread out across a dozen settlements.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#e69138][size=3]Compatibility[/size][/color][/b]\r<br />\r<br />This should be compatible with all other weapons, and all grenades that have the appropriate vanilla keyword, although the infinite ammo trick doesn&#39;t work for mini nukes.\r<br />\r<br />Armor sorting relies upon Armor and Weapon Keyword Community Resource. Armors that do not have its keywords will be moved to Junk upon sorting. They can still be hand-placed into the appropriate containers prior to distribution.\r<br />\r<br />This is compatible with Sim Settlements.\r<br />\r<br />Patches are available for Better Settlers.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#e69138][size=3]Known Issues[/size][/color][/b]\r<br />\r<br />When you install F4SE, it looks like you need to also install the files in the Data/Scripts section of the download. This is not mentioned in F4SE&#39;s installation instructions. I thought it was only needed if you want to compile F4SE scripts, but I&#39;ve been getting reports from my Jetpack Overhaul that they&#39;re needed.\r<br />\r<br />Settlers have default outfits that stick around even after you&#39;ve removed their original armor via this mod. The only way around this that I can see is to edit settler NPCs to replace their outfits with leveled list-generated clothing. This means compatibility patches are needed for any mods that alter settlers. A patch is available for Better Settlers.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#e69138]v2.0 Only[/color][/b]\r<br />\r<br />Distributing armor to power armor equipped settlers causes them to lose their power armor (fixed as of v2.01).\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#e69138]v1.0 Only\r<br />[/color][/b]\r<br />&#34;Retrieve Settler Weapons to Junk&#34; and &#34;Retrieve Settler Weapons to Equipment&#34; options are swapped for basic armory containers, meaning you&#39;ll retrieve weapons to the wrong storage category.\r<br />\r<br />Your settlers&#39; currently equipped weapons are removed to junk storage as the weapons are distributed. At present, this means that if there aren&#39;t enough weapons in your equipment box, some settlers will end up without a weapon (I need to add a check that stops removing weapons when the weapon container is empty).\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[b][color=#e69138][size=3]Recommended Mods[/size][/color][/b]\r<br />\r<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/25716/?]Telestorage[/url] - This mod lets you teleport looted items directly to settlements without having to pick them up.

I am [u]not the developer[/u] of[url=http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/3625875-vault-girl-mod-development-thread/] this mod[/url], but I decided to make my own FOMOD installer. Previously, I did not want to install the textures and some perks from the original Fomod. Also, I got game problems due to old \"forced to install\" files, and I was not the only one. The reason I uploaded it here is to share it with you guys as well as to make possible to manage it with Vortex as a small bonus. I believe the mod will become more popular (since it has never been published on NexusMods), and the people that are able to finish it will probably appear here =) Hopefully, you find my work useful.\n<br />\n<br />This mod aims to replace parts of Vault Boy UI (for the most part) and vanilla Vault Girl UI with a new Vault Girl UI. There are three Vault Girl types: A, B, and C. Currently, it is still Alpha version, and the mod is ON HOLD and not finished yet (LEVEL UP perks, Pip-boy-STAT-PERKS, and Pip-boy-DATA-QUESTS). However, I find it quite good even without those unfinished animations.

Therefore, I decided to fix the problems and also add several new options.\n<br />What is done:\n<br />[spoiler]0) The beautiful Vault Girl Mod is finally on NexusMods, and you can mange its files by using Vortex! No more manual installation and bug fixes.\n<br />1) Now, Sign and Poster textures are downloaded separately and previously built-in DEF_UI installation files are removed, what makes the mod size much much smaller (900Mb--&gt;30Mb) and fixes the problem when the \"None\" option for the textures in the original mod did not work correctly.\n<br />2) Vault Girl options are systemized and more flexible making it possible to select \"None\" and install/not install several previously hidden perks.\n<br />3) Added the compatibility patch for the Extended Dialogue Interface. Files copied from [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/35278]here[/url].\n<br />4) Added LEVEL UP colored animations of Vault Girl A, which are copied from [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/14252]here[/url].\n<br />5) Removed excessive files from the archive so that the installation becomes faster and the mod should not cause game crashes or corruption of other mods.[/spoiler]\n<br />I used the [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/6821]FOMOD Creation Tool[/url] and [url=https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v7.6.4.html]Notepad++[/url] to create the installer. [u]If anything works wrong or is missing, please inform me via the Bugs section.[/u]\n<br />\n<br />[u][color=#00ff00][size=4]Development:[/size][/color][/u]\n<br />Unfortunately, I am not good in modding and drawing. However, if you guys can create any patches, I will be glad to upload them here or give you an access to edit this NexusMods page. If you have any files to add, I am able to update the FOMOD installer with them.

Not challenging enough? Are you too OP from your high level and the enemies are boring? Sick of walking all over commonwealth with an empty shell of a wasteland? Wish there were more things to kill? - Then this mod is for you![/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#ffd966][size=3]Description[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]This mod is a deep revision of my original spawn mod, called [/size][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/9845][size=3]Commonwealth Spawns Extended[/size][/url][size=3], it contains many changes and improvements over my old project. As mod’s name implies, the main purpose of this mod is to bring more life to the Commonwealth wastes by adding new spawn points for enemy NPCs, animals, and creatures. The addition of thousands of new spawned enemies makes the commonwealth much more chaotic and dangerous, while bringing in entirely new possibilities, including tactical game play and more difficult supplies management. Depending on the spawn setting, the mod can offer a completely new game experience, from a slightly enhanced vanilla spawn system to the extreme hardcore.  This mod brings back enjoyment for game combat and mechanics, from lonesome wanderer in a desolate world, to the new dynamic and chaotic wasteland, where your in game choices, character build and tactical choices will matter more than in the vanilla game. This really makes you believe that the Commonwealth had those 200+ years for the mutants to reproduce and the humans to build a base of their presence in the area.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffd966]Reviews by Jr Mods (4:10 at timeline) and It'sAGundam (5:10) [/color]\n<br />[youtube]r5DjjsIv_Vc[/youtube][youtube]MLVGKUp5OD4[/youtube]\n<br />[size=3][center][color=#ffd966]Review by TheAdipose [/color][/center]\n<br />[center][youtube]SH5W-2wbO-I[/youtube][/center]\n<br />[center][color=#ffd966]General gameplay on high spawn settings by me and Glowing Sea high spawns in video by Wrath3094 (5:05 in timeline).[/color][/center]\n<br />[center][youtube]Jko4XgnbU-A[/youtube][youtube]yJ4xCMxxiPI[/youtube][/center]\n<br />[center][color=#ffd966]Gameplay on low spawns by SyntheticKill, and medium setting gameplay by Corey Hooe.[/color][/center]\n<br />[center][youtube]8g09Zor5vys[/youtube][youtube]DnF2tay1NiL[/youtube][/center][/size]\n<br />[line]\n<br />[b][color=#ffd966][size=3]FEATURES[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=#ff7700]*[/color] A complete spawn overhaul for Commonwealth exteriors, with addition of thousands of spawn points for enemy groups in outskirts of Boston as well as in city itself.[/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=#ff7700]*[/color] Large variety of spawn settings, including spawn point area density, numbers of units in spawned groups, group patrolling, chances of spawning story factions in certain areas, randomness of unit count in spawned groups and respawn settings for new enemy groups.[/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=#ff7700]*[/color] Mod uses random number generator (RNG) based scripts to switch between different group placement points and group enemy numbers. This mechanism offers fully dynamic spawning, with high degree of randomness, meaning you will almost never meet same enemy groups at the same place.[/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=#ff7700]*[/color] All placed spawns are not static anymore and will go on the patrols in the surrounding areas. This new additions brings up completely new experience since you will never know, when and where you will meet the enemy. Your in-game situation can escalate in very unexpected and dramatic fashion, forcing you to react and do tactical decisions on the fly. [/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=#ff7700]*[/color] Faction of the spawned groups will be different depending on area you are in. Many locations in the game will have individual faction lists for new spawns, modelling major faction area of influence. This mechanic offers you a great diversity of encountered enemies, allowing you to encounter any faction from the game. [/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=#ff7700]*[/color] Special group compositions for any generated NPC groups. Each group will have leaders, strong, medium and weak mobs in it. Larger groups will have much greater chance to have some strong units and legendary leaders. Some hard faction unit variations, including power-armored mobs will be common sight in the whole CW area.[/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=#ff7700]*[/color] New spawns will include many factions underused by the vanilla game. Commonly you will encounter some Forged, and DLC Raider-bots along with normal raiders, will encounter Triggermen in central Boston and so on.[/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=#ff7700]*[/color] Mod uses new mechanics to generate story faction spawns. That includes Minutemen patrols around the player owned settlements and Minutemen/BOS/Railroad patrols in central Boston and Cambridge areas. Minutemen settlement based patrols will become more numerous and expand their patrol area further from their base, based on settlement population and happiness, while chances to see Railroad and BOS groups will depend on story progression.[/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=#ff7700]*[/color] Adjusted encounter zones, with increased enemy levels, while moving from the Sanctuary corner to the south, for the Quincy and Glowing Sea Areas. Increased levels dramatically rise the chance to see mobs, that are greater than your current level, meaning not any fight can be won, forcing you make new tactical decisions based on enemies you encounter.[/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=#ff7700]*[/color] Mod completely overhauls the Glowing Sea area, which will be populated by the most dangerous enemies, such as swarms of Supermutants, deathclaws, robots, children of atom and ghouls. That place is a dangerous warzone, as it was intended to be.[/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#ff7700]*[/color][size=3] In overall,mod content includes about 50000 of new placed NPC’s and creatures, around 1500 of new group spawn points and patrol routes in common CW area, around 200 group spawn points and patrol routes in cites, and around 200 Minutemen settlement based conditional patrol groups/routes.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=#ff7700]*[/color] New in 1.2 - Several new Railroad and Synth weapon and outfit loadouts.

You can use NMM to handle install process for you, or you can install the mod manually, using the following general method:[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=#ff7700]1.[/color][/size][/b][size=3] Extract the contents of the provided mod archive file into your Fallout4/Data folder. [/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=#ff7700]2.[/color][/size][/b][size=3] Navigate to/Users/Username/AppData/local/Fallout4 folder.

[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=#ff7700]6.[/color][/size][/b][size=3] Run the game. \n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffd966][b]Important note:[/b][/color] This mod is resource intensive and extensively uses papyrus scripting. To assure maximum performance and stability it is best to install mod in conflict-resolved setup (by means of [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/2737/?]FO4Edit[/url]) and start a new game.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][s]Also, due to the changes in game play, it is imperative to address the no sprint problem, caused by modifying game Cells. This problem is common to any mod that changes these, and is important to fix this up since you will probably be sprinting a lot. To fix sprinting bug, place the following entry in your Fallou4.ini and Fallout4Custom.ini, located in /Documents/My Games/Fallout4 folder. This problem has been resolved by Bethesda.[/s] [color=#f1c232]If you are experiencing this issue still, it is because you have problems with a mod you have installed affecting the cell you experience it in. Having the \"No Previs\" flag marked in a cell that actually has working Precom meshes will cause this.\n<br />[/color][/size][quote][size=3][color=#b6b6b6][Gameplay][/color]\n<br />fPlayerDisableSprintingLoadingCellDistance=0[/size][/quote][size=3]\n<br />[line]\n<br />[b][color=#ffd966]Detailed feature description / Menu Settings.[/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#ff7700]Presets (menu 0).[/color][/b] This menu is self-explanatory. I had added some settings here you can use to get what you want without setting things up by yourself. However, i want to specially note that these preset settings will not suit everyone, and the better way to configure this mod is to set your personal settings !!! Some of settings in other menus are important in terms of gameplay change and feel they bring to your game. Pay the special attention to switch on or off general enemy patrols, setting these to off will bring experience close to my old CSE mod, while turning them on will make hell break loose and turn CW into warzone area.[color=#1e84cc] [/color][color=#ffff00]Don't use the presets blindly, take some time to set up settings that will suit you play![/color]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#ff7700]Spawnpoint Frequency (menu 1).[/color][/b] Area density is the main instrument to control number of spawned groups. Internally mod uses very dense spawn maps, containing a large number of possible spawn positions, while the area density setting controls probability applied on loading, for each point of this grid to become active and spawn the enemy group. Random nature of this selection process is center of dynamic spawning feature, allowing different group placements each time player enters the area. Of course higher area density means that more enemy groups will spawn, leading to additional demand on user’s PC performance, required to maintain path finding and combat AI of placed enemy NPCs. It is advised not to use high area density settings on low performance machines, since it will lead to notable drop in game performance and stability. High-density setting can also break gameplay for some people since where will be many enemies all around. \n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#ff7700]Number Of Units In Groups (menu 2).[/color][/b] Group sizes is another major setting that controls the generated population, despite of the self-explanatory name of this setting, it’s work is not so simple as one can think. Each spawn point added by the mod can produce groups of different sizes, and one to be used is selected based on setting set in the control menus for corresponding area (2.1-2.4). This simple behavior exists only then random group size chance is set to zero in the Dynamic group sizes submenu (2.0), if corresponding value is not zero, this random chance will be applied each time spawn point is activated to make deviations from uniformly set group size. Dynamic group size modifier is simply a chance of ANY group to be random in size, selected based on the value, provided by the random number generator. So setting for example medium group sizes as the main setting with 25% random chance will lead to 75% medium size groups and 25% random size groups. Setting chance to 100% will mean that all groups, that are generated by the mod will have random sizes, setting to 0 will lead to fixed group sizes at all times. So, these settings have a long way, as it comes to enemy spawn diversity, and should be set properly to maintain desired degree of randomness. \n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#ff7700]Story faction spawns (menu 3).[/color][/b] This menu controls the special mod features related to story faction spawns. Minutemen (and other story faction) patrols will be available in the surroundings of any settlement controlled by player. Number of active patrol routes will depend on number of people in the base settlement and their happiness and is capped by maximum of 7 patrols. Exact value of active patrols generated by settlement depend on (Number of settlers * happiness / 100) score: value from 3 to 4 will unlock 1 patrol, 5 – 6 two patrols, 7 – 9 three patrols, 9 - 10 (4 patrols), 11-12 (5 patrols), 13 – 15 (6 patrols, while score greater than 15 will activate all 7 patrols. Lower 2 patrols will always make circles around the settlement, simulating sort of the security force, while other 5 will be away from the settlement, going further away from settlement, expanding its control area. Patrols active on higher score will also have more units, up to 8-9 on the top ones. Most of the patrols will be Minutemen, but could also be other story factions, once player is their member (BOS/Rail/Synth). You could also set a chance, that will be used to select non-Minutemen faction settlement patrol in submenu (3.1). Increase in number of controlled settlements will also raise the chance of Minutemen spawns in all CW areas, the maximum value of this chance could be set using submenu (3.0). That chance will be applied to ALL NPC spawn points in the CW countryside areas, and on successful RNG roll will replace spawn of enemy group with spawn of Minutemen recon team. Other important faction settings are minimum (submenu 3.2) and maximum (submenu 3.3) chances of story factions inside the central Boston and Cambridge. On successful RNG roll against these chances, enemy spawns within cities will be replaced by some story faction (MM/BOS/Railroad). Chance of spawning exact story faction depends on current faction status. For example, Brotherhood patrols will be relatively frequent only on airship arrival, Minutemen chance will rise with number of controlled settlements, while railroad chance will be set to sum of some constant chance and railroad story progression (bos/inst destroyed, player membership). As all other spawns in the mod, story faction spawns will do patrolling.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#ff7700]Group Patrol Settings (menu 4).[/color][/b] Patrols are one of the most distinctive features of the mod, and have a big contribution for gameplay dynamic. Area you are in may seem void and clear, and when, all the sudden you can find yourself in the big fight with unexpected enemy patrol headed you way. All other enemy groups are on patrols as well and some of them will gladly join your little party this first one and so on. These multiple patrols crossings makes the core of the mod experience, making it fell like a real war is going on in the CW. Multiple sided faction fights will be common all around the CW, some of them can reach a really epic scales. While patrols are certainly good in bringing new game experience, they are also place more pressure on game engine. If, at some point you want to increase game performance, or want experience close to my old CSE mod, you can turn these off using corresponding submenu.  \n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#ff7700]Group Respawn Timers (menu 5).[/color][/b] This menu control mod’s respawning timers, these will have huge effect depending on other spawning settings. Original game resets cells on regular basis using 168-hour delay for normal cells and 480 in game hours for ‘cleared’ locations. Since this mod adds new spawns not existent in normal game, and have several groups loaded to any spawn point, it cannot use internal game respawning mechanism properly. For example if where will be no re-population time control, mod will generate new groups each time you come close to spawn point, never matter if you cleared this area just a hour ago. This means that areas will never be cleared of enemies (in reality clearing is possible, if you kill all groups placed into one spawn point, until game normal respawn timer ticks out). To control the flow of spawned units mod uses it’s own respawn timer to determine whenever the spawn point should be repopulated. Where are separate settings here for CW countryside (submenu 5.0), spawns in city areas (submenu 5.1) and settlement patrols (5.2). Setting shorter timers and especially setting it to 0 will result in huge increase of population in the corresponding zones. In addition, due to increased demand on cleaning of used game assets, and to affect overall mod dynamic, normal game engine cell respawn timers set to 6 hours for normal cells and to 24 hours for ‘cleared’ cells. \n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#ff7700]Spawn Limiter (menu 6).[/color][/b] This is somewhat advanced setting, allowing you to set limit for number of spawned groups, that could be active at the same time. This setting will be applied on the top of all other settings, and will deny all spawns higher then set limit, it will not care the type of spawn that is being requested. This setting can be used for total population control independent from other settings and at least provides the way for people with low PC performance to set the limits, suitable for their machine. By default limiter is to unrestricted after 1.1b version, since turning the limit on will dramatically affect the measure of chaos you will see in CW. For best experience i recommend not to turn this on and leave alone default unrestricted settings, however one can still use this if needed. Use this setting wisely.\n<br />\n<br />[line]\n<br />[b][color=#ffd966]Compatibility, stability and savefile size.[/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />Please note, that mods relies heavily on game engine performance, and uses heavy scripting to get things running, so take care on the load order you are using, do not overtax your game by giant mod lists and high number of resource intensive mods. Failing to do this can ruin the game stability and lead to some bugs or crashes without the apparent reason. Stability and performance of this mod will be directly proportional to the level of purity in conflict resolution it your mod load order (note below).\n<br />\n<br />It's recommended that all players start on medium settings and adjust to a level that's right for your game play style. This is especially true for users on slower computers. When using this mod at its higher settings, slower computers might encounter severe frame rate reduction due to the immense amount of pure chaos taking place within your game. This can also lead to CTD issues if the game is overtaxed on slower PCs.  If you start having CTD issues, the first thing you should do is lower the spawn settings.\n<br />\n<br />In general mod inter compatibility depends from whatever the do edit the same things in their corresponding plugin files, if multiple mods edit the same thing that leads to conflict, resulting in instability and frequent or permanent crashes. If crash does not happen, that does not mean that all is good, mods can still be screwed by each other. On multiple edits of the same thing game will use the values placed by the mod what was loaded last, overwriting edits made by other mods. \n<br />\n<br />This mod places many new objects into the worldspace, so it alters many Cells to place them into the game world. Any mod, altering Cells WILL conflict with any other that also changes them. The only compatibility possible here is to make all mods never edit the same cells, changing only different ones. There are hundreds of Cell changing mods up where, so where is really no physical chance to make compatibility patches for them all. In such cases, as in all other cases of mod conflicts one should use excellent toll [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/2737/?]FO4Edit[/url] to resolve the conflicts. To learn how to do that, one could use excellent video tutorial by the CrussBoss it could be found here: [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oG2jlSLptY]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oG2jlSLptY[/url]\n<br />\n<br />Before making any blame for crashes on the mod author make sure that you understand notes above, and make sure you used appropriate mod setup. The tips above are general ones and apply to all mods out where, so take care to resolve your mod conflicts in FO4Edit first, before blaming someone in the bugs section. \n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#ff7700]Note on saved games:[/color] [/b]Since this mod adds many new object into the game world, and game engine have edited cells vector loaded into memory all the times, it also means the appropriate increase of savegame file size. Exact same reason applies to increased game loading time. More content require more resources, where is no way around that. Please take a special note, that such increase in save file size due to added Cell content have nothing to do with the famous savegame ‘bloating’ problem, caused by engine and script junk, persistently moving from one save to another, even their parent problem making mods are removed from your load order. Save files with this mod will be much larger then normal, but this does not mean that saves are bloated and will become unreadable. This is not the case here.\n<br />\n<br />[line]\n<br />[b][color=#ffd966]Tactical advice[/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />With a lot more enemies around, game play becomes much more resource and ammo demanding.  Ammo will be worth it's weight in gold.  Depending on the spawn setting, one will quickly realise that you can't kill everything, and that fighting one group of enemies can attract another, leading to you being surrounded and getting killed. That is where the true enjoyment part comes in, and it comes in the form of tactical game play, creating more decision making: who should you fight and when, should you retreat or risk being flanked or surrounded, do you have enough ammo and stims to reach your map destination and many more decisions like that. This leaves you with a vast variety of choices, that can literally cost you your life while exploring the wastes. So the main advice here is to use your head for route planning, use tactics and stealth to dispose or avoid enemy groups, use any of your perk advantages (like some good melee stats will save you a lot of ammo, aqua boy will allow water safe travel and so on). Use your settlements not for decoration, but as safe zones, where you can heal your wounds, resupply and rest. There are many ways to conquer the new wasteland hazards, and final choices are all up to you.[/size]\n<br />[size=3] [/size]\n<br />[b][size=3][color=#ff7700]*[/color][/size][/b][size=3] When facing weak mobs, it may be wise to conserve your ammo and use melee weapons instead. Use area attacks to break clustered enemies, your grenades and explosives are much more valuable here. [/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=#ff7700]*[/color][/size][/b][size=3] With the level of difficulty this mod provides, try to avoid enemies or disengage from a fight when you feel drastically outnumbered/ outgunned/ surrounded. [/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=#ff7700]*[/color][/size][/b][size=3] Take care to listen to your surroundings for distant gunfire that may tell you where you should go, and what area you wish to avoid. Try to stay alert and do some recon before you enter large open land areas. [/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=#ff7700]*[/color][/size][/b][size=3] Always use terrain to your advantage, don't take a stand in a place with no cover. Use a jetpack to get to positions unreachable by the enemy, use mines and lure. Protect your flanks and back. Always be on the lookout for the places, which can be useful in making a stand in case of facing overwhelming odds, and for possible escape routes. [/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=#ff7700]*[/color][/size][/b][size=3] Keep in mind that you don't have to fight every enemy you see or hear. They'll usually fight it out amongst another group nearby, this might give you the opportunity to sneak by undetected, or possibly lure one group of enemies into another while you collect all what’s left after they kill each other. [/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=#ff7700]*[/color][/size][/b][size=3] Flank enemy groups engaging each other, selecting the side intended to win as your target. When the fight is coming to the end, shoot them in their backs, to eliminate all remaining resistance if necessary. [/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=#ff7700]*[/color][/size][/b][size=3] Use your settlements to your advantage. Settlements with good defenses set up can be excellent way to defeat grouped enemies by luring them to your settlement. Use them as safe zones where you can rest, replenish ammo at shops, use your settlement doctor to heal you up, etc. Use your settlement artillery to scatter/break enemy groups, or as way to clean a passage through the area.

                "description": "This mod makes it so NPC humans and civilized ghouls will drop their weapon and run away when they are on fire. No more of this, \"it's OK that I'm on fire let me slowly strafe, and calmly steady my aim at you,\" no. fuck that. \n<br />\n<br />YOU. ARE. ON. F I R E . \n<br />\n<br />Drop your gun and act like you give a shit.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffff00][u][b]This mod affects:[/b][/u][/color]\n<br />Molotovs\n<br />Flame thrower\n<br />Incendiary shots\n<br />Lasers with fire mods\n<br />Special NPC fire abilities\n<br />Oil traps\n<br />Fire hazards\n<br />And a few others!\n<br />This mod skips altering a few fire hazards that are labeled as having small effects.\n<br />\n<br />There are 2 versions available of this mod.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ff00][b][u]Version 1 (cool version):[/u][/b][/color]\n<br />When hit with a molotov or set on fire, civilized ghouls and human NPCs will be staggered hard, have their shootin' arm crippled, drop their gun, and they will run away. When NPCs run away they zip away at ridiculous speed so I added a slowing effect (curable if the NPC uses a Stimpak) and debuffed their action points for 30 sec so they can't sprint (cannot stimpak out of the action point debuff). Molotovs work the same as vanilla on anyone in power armor because well, it's power armor![color=#00ffff][u][b] All of these new features to fire have no effect on the player[/b][/u];[/color] we're already smart (or dumb) enough to panic when we are on fire. \n<br />\n<br />In order to make this cool version work and make NPCs reliably drop their gun, I made it so humans and civilized ghouls can no longer use crippled limbs. It's awesome. \n<br />[color=#00ffff][u][b]Note: you the player are still susceptible to limb crippling from gunfire or anything else that hits you, including fire, you are just immune to the artificial limb crippling added to fire effects.[/b][/u][/color]\n<br />If you like crippling enemies but you prefer to be immune to crippling you can either wait until you level up and get the Adamantium Skeleton perk or you download the optional Player Immune to Cripple file.\n<br />\n<br />In order to make crippled limbs unusable I had to edit a HumanRace and GhoulRace value. I have no idea if this will conflict with any anime chick body overhaul cartoon cheerleader boob physics mods you're using but if it does I have a suck version available:\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff0000][b][u]Version 2 (suck version):\n<br />[/u][/b][/color]This version does almost all the same things except instead of enabling unusable crippled limbs and crippling the arm it simply disarms the victim and applies a fear effect to make them run (there's also a fear effect in version 1 for good measure but it's probably redundant with a crippled arm). The downside to this is enemies will very often just pick the weapon right back up or go grab another weapon near their new location after running away. Also sometimes they just don't even run.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff7700][u][b]Possibly weird behavior:[/b][/u][color=#000000] \n<br />[/color][/color]In order to make NPCs reliably run away I added an effect that actually heals crippled legs. Otherwise the molotov has a chance of crippling their legs and they just sit on the floor staring at you while they roast and it looks dumb. So if you cripple a leg and then decide to set them on fire, this is why they are able to magically run again.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff7700][b][u]Other weird behavior:[/u][/b][/color]\n<br />Honestly this mod is just changing NPCs from displaying reeeeeally weird behavior to less weird behavior. I don't think it would take much imagination to make something better and I hope someone does. I would love to see NPCs on fire truly freaking out and and flailing or trying to protect their face but I have no idea how to do that and I have no plans of ever learning how to animate stuff.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff0000][b][u]Conflicts:[/u][/b][/color]\n<br />If you use CROSS Crit Gore overhaul just put this mod somewhere [s]above[/s] below CROSS Crit in your load order. Thanks [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/users/11355265]DerekUGA[/url].\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ff00][b][u]Installing:[/u][/b][/color]\n<br />Just install as usual with Nexus Mod Manager\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ff00][u][b]Uninstalling:[/b][/u][/color]\n<br />Just uninstall as usual with Nexus Mod Manager. There shouldn't be any residual effects at all. This mod just adds a few tweaked \"spell\" effects alongside vanilla fire damage over time spells.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffff00][u]Requirements:[/u][/color]\n<br />Not really a requirement but I highly recommend using this with some damage overhaul or realism mods such as unbogus health scaling and MADNESS to make the NPC's fire-to-death time feel satisfying and believable.\n<br />DLC and non-DLC version available.\n<br />[color=#00ffff][b][u]\n<br />Getting your hott pervy mods to work with version 1.1:[/u][/b][/color]\n<br />You'll have to google some mod conflict manager software or just open your body mod in the Creation Kit and remove the checkbox in HumanRace and GhoulRace that says they're allowed to use crippled limbs.

Or at the very least, his \"Ghoul Edition\" on its own? Do you wish robots also were leveled up? Do you find it odd that blowing a robot's arm up causes it to just die like it was some sort of squishy organic being? Do you find it odd that robots that have been wandering around 200 years can go down with a few pipe pistol shots? Want Sentry Bots to be the monstrous machines they were meant to be?\n<br />\n<br />This mod is for you. \n<br />\n<br />This \"unofficial\" addition to [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/users/8515543]Zzyxzz[/url]'s \"[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/3815]Better Locational Damage[/url]\" does to robots what \"Ghoul Edition\" does for ghouls, but much differently. \n<br />\n<br />[/size][list]\n<br />[*][size=3]Robots now operate on a sort of \"Mechwarrior\" type system: Robots no longer take health damage simply by shooting at their arms, legs, and head. [u]They only take damage if you shoot at the torso (where the reactor is). [/u]However, doing so will still cripple them, and blowing their arms off will still cause them to self-destruct. In some cases, it may actually be MORE beneficial to destroy their limbs than it is to destroy the core itself.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Affects Protectrons, Handies/Gutsies, Assaultrons, Robobrains, Sentries, and (Gen 1/2) Synths.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Robots are tougher to destroy in general. After all, they've been operational for over 200 years in most cases, a raider with a pipe pistol or the stray molerat isn't going to do much to them.[/size]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][size=3]Protectrons and Handies/Gutsies are still bottom of the barrel, but are still tougher than they are in vanilla. You will find it rather difficult to destroy one with a pipe pistol.﻿  [/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Assaultrons are military-grade melee robots. You'll need concentrated fire to take one down.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Robobrains are very strong enemies now.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Sentry Bots are almost deathclaw-tier level threats. ﻿﻿[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Synths are a bit stronger than protectrons, but FAR weaker than assaultrons. Keep in mind that they also love to travel in packs. You'll quickly see why the commonwealth farmers fear these things so much.[/size]\n<br />[/list][/list]   ﻿[font=Tahoma][size=2]   ﻿(Keep in mind that in the case of Automatron Robots, a robot's \"race\" is determined by their [u]legs[/u], NOT by their torsos. A Robot that has a protectron head, a robobrain body, assaultron arms, and sentry bot legs counts as a sentry bot, not as a robobrain or protectron. I know this is weird, but that's something hard-coded into vanilla, there's nothing I can do about this sadly.)[/size][/font]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][size=3]Pulse Grenades/Mines and the Lightning Gun are more effective against robots now.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Just to make sure Automatron isn't a complete nightmare, Rust Devil and Mechanist robots take a bit more damage.[/size]\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[size=4]I recommend you run this with my other mod, [/size][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/39552][size=4]Automatron Randomized Bots[/size][/url][size=4], as well as the aformentioned \"Better Locational Damage\" mod.

While it is meant to compliment that mod, just like that mod's \"Ghoul Edition,\" this mod can be used stand alone, so you can use it with something like Unbogus if you wish, or just by itself.[/size][*][size=3][b]\"Are there any scripts?\"[/b] [/size]\n<br />[size=3]Nope. No scripts.[/size][*][size=3][b]\"Load Order?\"[/b] [/size]\n<br />[size=3]On the bottom. It's a ES(L)P, so it will not take up ESP space.

Mister Undertaker, an early prototype model, was quietly introduced a short while later.\n<br />\n<br />Mister Rescue met with commercial success and was subsequently marketed to consumers as Mister GroundsKeeper in 2045 with notable sales revenue from golf courses, vacation resorts, and daycare centers.\n<br />\n<br />2055 saw the release of Mister Salvage &amp; Reclamation (later rebranded \"Mister Salvage\").  Revenue for this Type-1d model was modest with purchase orders primarily from construction and landscaping firms.\n<br />\n<br />That same year, the Vault-Tec Corporation acquired exclusive rights for a Mister Tidy Type-1e model (essentially a redesign of the Mister Undertaker prototype) which was subsequently deployed at Vault-Tec's numerous facilities.[/size][/i]\n<br />\n<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[/center]\n<br />[b][size=3][color=lightgreen]Key Features:[/color][/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />• Automatic Operation\n<br />• Limited to One per Settlement\n<br />• Continues working while its Cell is unloaded\n<br />• Recovered items are transferred to the Station Pad's chest\n<br />• Waits at the station pad when there is currently nothing to tidy\n<br />• Tidying requires wall-clock time and is not affected by Wait, Sleep, or Fast Travel\n<br />• The content of Mr Tidy's chest can be extracted using a Vacuum Hopper (Contraptions Workshop DLC)\n<br />\n<br />This mod provides a \"lore friendly\" approach for removing corpses and other dead things from a settlement by enabling you to assign that task to a Vault-Tec [color=lightblue][b]Mister Tidy[/b][/color] robot.  Just place the 'bot in a central area, instruct it to begin tidying, wait a minute for it to \"beep\" (or makes cheerful noises when there is nothing to tidy up), and then feel free to resume your adventures.\n<br />\n<br />Mr. Tidy can be directed to tidy things within the boundaries of that settlement, or for a distance that can extend beyond those boundaries, with tidying always centered on its station pad.  Mr. Tidy returns to the station pad upon completion.  It then waits there until it is instructed to resume, or is stored in its workshop, or is scrapped.  Items recovered from corpses are stored in the station pad's chest.\n<br />\n<br />There is a brief initial mission / quest which provides a bit of backstory and conveys essential usage information.  It normally begins after escaping from Vault 111.  For those using an \"alternate start\" mod, it begins while outdoors in the Commonwealth (the main game area) -- or try visiting Sanctuary Hills and stand near the Workshop for a few minutes.\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=white]NOTE:[/color][/size][/b]  This is a mod for removing dead things, but which also automatically collects items for you from those dead things. It is not intended to be just a looting mod. So players who do not desire dead things to be removed (perhaps because of the behavior of some other mod) should simply not use Mr Tidy.\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=white]ANOTHER NOTE:[/color][/size][/b]  Create a saved game before tidying a settlement -- one that you can return to if issues are encountered.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=lightgreen]How To Build:[/color][/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />Mister Tidy is placed in a settlement by using a WorkShop to build a Station Pad.  The station pad can be found in the STRUCTURES&gt;MISCELLANEOUS section of the WorkShop's building menu when an initial quest (\"Rest In Peace\") is completed.  The quest appears shortly after leaving Vault 111 for normal play, or when outdoors in the Commonwealth when using an \"alternate start\" mod. If the quest does not appear when expected, then double-check to confirm that this mod has been enabled.\n<br />\n<br />When opening a workshop to build something, you initially see the user interface positioned at a wooden building with \"Structures\" as a label above it. Go upwards one row from there, and then go over to the right along that row until you see \"Structures&gt;Miscellaneous\" as a label; in the base game that label is above a bloodied super mutant pole but may be something different depending on the mods you installed. Now go up one row from there. Everything you then see horizontally in that row is the \"Structures&gt;Miscellaneous\" subcategory. In that row will be the Mister Tidy Station Pad; perhaps as the very first item.\n<br />\n<br />It is best to position the Station Pad on the ground in the central area of a settlement in such a way that Mister Tidy will have easy access to places within the settlement's boundaries.\n<br />\n<br />If you are not able to find the\"Structures&gt;Miscellaneous\" subcategory, then you installed a mod that alters the basic construction categories of the game. In which case you may not be able to build the Station Pad, and hence will not be able to use this mod -- if you are lucky, the conflicting mod may have simply rearranged items, with the Station Pad now residing elsewhere in some other category or subcategory instead of where it was intended to be.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=lightgreen]Tidying Up:[/color][/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />Mr. Tidy automatically removes the following \"remains\" and stores any recovered items that they may have contained in the station pad's Chest:\n<br />\n<br />• Corpses\n<br />• Dead Things\n<br />• Skeletons\n<br />• Bone Fragments\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=lightgreen]Mr. Tidy Status:[/color][/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />Mr. Tidy's station pad has colored indicators which identify the bot's current status:\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=yellow]Yellow[/color][/b]  --  Mr. Tidy has not yet been activated.  Interact with the station pad to begin tidying.  The colored indicators will then become Blue.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=lightblue]Blue[/color][/b]  --  Mr.Tidy is currently gathering cleanup information.  The player should remain in the settlement while the indicators are Blue.  When the cleanup information has been collected, the indicators will become Green if there are \"remains\" to be tidied, or will become White if there is no work to be done.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=lightgreen]Green[/color][/b]  --  Mr. Tidy is currently analyzing cleanup information or actively traveling around to tidy things up.  Mr. Tidy will Beep when the indicators become Green.  The bot will now be able to continue tidying while the player is away from the settlement.  The indicators will become White when cleanup has been completed.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=white]White[/color][/b]  --  Mr. Tidy is currently idle while waiting to begin the next tidying cycle.  This is the time to store (or scrap) a settlement's Mr. Tidy when its job is completed.  Tidying is resumed by interacting with the station pad.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=lightgreen]Scan Range:[/color][/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />The scan range for both \"long range\" and \"within settlement boundaries\" is 10,000 units of game-world distance.  So the difference between those choices is simply whether particular remains are processed (inside the bounds) or not (outside the bounds) when Mr Tidy's station pad is positioned in a settlement's central area.  Short Range is 3,500 units.  Medium Range is 6,000 units.\n<br />\n<br />10,000 units is far enough to span the interior of base-game settlements when Mr Tidy's station pad is centrally positioned.  I have never used the DLCs so do not know the coverage for their settlements.  And of course coverage will vary when using mods that alter settlement boundaries or add new settlements.\n<br />\n<br />As an example, just over the bridge from Sanctuary there is initially a dead NPC and a dead dog.  They are outside Sanctuary's settlement boundary and so are never processed when using \"within settlement boundaries\", but are processed when using \"long range\" with Mr Tidy's station pad positioned near Sanctuary's workshop.  The distance from that workshop to the corpses is approximately 8,500 units.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=lightgreen]Installation:[/color][/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />Install using a mod manager, or unpack the mod and copy the .ESP/.ESL and .BA2 files into the game's &#92;DATA folder, then enable the mod.\n<br />\n<br />Position this mod's .ESP/.ESL file to be as low as it will go in your \"Load Order\" sequence.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=lightgreen]Install ESP or ESL?[/color][/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />If you are reaching the maximum allowed number of .ESP installs, and want to install more mods, then install the .ESL versions of those new mods ...\n<br />\n<br />Back-in-the-day, many players were reaching the maximum number of allowed .ESP installs, so Bethesda introduced a way to permit more via .ESL files.\n<br />\n<br />The Light Master (.ESL) file is an optimized file format introduced in the Fallout 4 v1.10 update. Using Light Master files allows more plugins (mods and patch mods) to be installed than previously possible with .ESP files. For .ESP files there is a limit of 255, whereas a maximum of 4096 .ESL files can be loaded (but in practice is difficult to achieve due to other technical constraints).\n<br />\n<br />Both file types can be used together, which means you can install just .ESP files if your install count remains below the .ESP maximum, or just .ESL files if your count remains below the .ESL maximum, or some of both such as using .ESP files initially and then adding .ESL files thereafter when the maximum for .ESP has been reached.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=lightgreen]ESP/ESL Compatibility:[/color][/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />Saved games that currently use an .ESP mod are not compatible with an .ESL of that same mod. Similarly, saved games that are currently using the .ESL for a mod are not compatible with an .ESP of that same mod.  That is a basic game restriction in terms of switching between .ESP and .ESL versions of a mod.  There is no \"fix\" or workaround -- it is inherent in the game's design.\n<br />\n<br />So, to switch from .ESP to .ESL, or from .ESL to .ESP, you must:\n<br />\n<br />1 ) uninstall the mod\n<br />2 ) load the current saved game\n<br />3 ) create a new saved game (while that mod is not installed)\n<br />4 ) install the other download of that mod\n<br />5 ) resume play with that newly created saved game\n<br />\n<br />Objects and NPCs provided by the mod will not be there now and must be created once more. Similarly, quests will need to be done again.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=lightgreen]Requirements:[/color][/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />No special requirements.  DLCs are not needed.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=lightgreen]Known Issues:[/color][/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />The game can be a bit quirky at times, which can result in an NPC becoming a bit confused (or even stuck) when traveling from one place to another.  When this happens for a Mr. Tidy, it automatically performs \"fast travel\" (teleports) back to its Station Pad.  So if you are watching Mr. Tidy, and it suddenly disappears, it has returned to its Station Pad and resumes its tidying activities from there.\n<br />\n<br />Mister Tidy, by necessity, uses a pathing mechanism that is less robust and more error prone than the one that NPCs and other Robots typically use.  As a result, Mister Tidy can be more readily befuddled by obstacles, especially with regard to fencing and walls that surround a settlement -- they will hinder its ability to enter and exit that place.   So an \"open\" settlement environment is generally best.\n<br />\n<br />If this mod's initial quest is not starting for you after being installed with the Vortex mod manager, it might be because it has not been properly activated/enabled.  If you click PLUGINS within Vortex, you will then see which mods are truly activated/enabled or not (whereas the MODS section sometimes shows incorrect information). Within that PLUGINS interface you can activate/enable the mods that were not properly set when installed.\n<br />\n<br />Corpses for NPCs created by the NPCs Travel mod are intentionally not removed because it breaks that mod by preventing those NPCs from re-spawning as intended.  So depending on the frequency/quantity/importance of NPCs Travel's enemies for a player's settlement fights, this mod might not be very useful.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=lightgreen]Known Conflicts:[/color][/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />There is a conflict between this mod and War Of The Commonwealth which can result in crashes.  I have identified the specific conflict, but at present there is no fix or workaround that I can provide.  So it is best to not use the two mods at the same time.\n<br />\n<br />[s]Corpses for NPCs created by the NPCs Travel mod will no longer re-spawn as originally intended if those corpses are tidied-away by Mr Tidy.[/s]  Fixed by NPCs Travel v2.95.\n<br />\n<br />The initial quest can be prevented from starting, or become stalled part-way through, when using a buggy \"quick start\" or \"alternate start\" mod.  The quest normally begins a short while after exiting from Vault 111 for the first time, or a short while after loading a saved game when already outdoors in the Commonwealth.  Otherwise, it might (or might not) begin when standing for a few minutes outdoors at the Sanctuary Hills workbench.\n<br />\n<br />If you experience crashes while traveling during the initial quest, or are unable to complete that quest, it is then highly likely some other mod has been installed that \"breaks\" the Vault 111 area (or possibly the Sanctuary settlement) thereby preventing this mod from working correctly.\n<br />\n<br />If you are not able to find the \"Structures&gt;Miscellaneous\" subcategory, then you installed a mod that alters the basic construction categories of the game. In which case you may not be able to build the Station Pad, and hence will not be able to use this mod -- if you are lucky, the conflicting mod may have simply rearranged items, with the Station Pad now residing elsewhere in some other category or subcategory instead of where it was intended to be. \n<br />\n<br />[s]Please be aware that \"Anom's Sanctuary Hills Overhaul\" has been reported to conflict with some of my Settlement mods, such that when both are installed the player is then no longer able to create a new saved game.  This might (or might not) be the case here as well.[/s]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=lightgreen]To Uninstall:[/color][/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />Uninstall with the mod manager that was used for the original install, or delete SettlementTidyBot files.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=lightgreen]Permissions:[/color][/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />This mod may not be reused in part or whole for any purpose other than its original intent.  It may not be uploaded to any other web site.\n<br />\n<br />Get in touch with me if you wish to discuss translation into a non-English language; prior approval is mandatory.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=lightgreen]Change Log:[/color][/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />See the Change Log to review what is included in each update.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=lightgreen]Credits:[/color][/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />Bethesda Softworks - for the original Models and Textures  [I merely provided the ingenuity and scripting to bring Mister Tidy \"to life\"]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=lightgreen]My Other Mods:[/color][/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />Shield Bubble can be found [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/30669][u][color=lightblue]Here[/color][/u][/url].\n<br />\n<br />Qwirky can be found [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/29576][u][color=lightblue]Here[/color][/u][/url].\n<br />\n<br />Sparky can be found [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/28051][u][color=lightblue]Here[/color][/u][/url].\n<br />\n<br />Silver Streak can be found [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/24911][u][color=lightblue]Here[/color][/u][/url].\n<br />\n<br />Silver Streak UFO can be found [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/24911][u][color=lightblue]Here[/color][/u][/url].\n<br />\n<br />Whirly can be found [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/13449][u][color=lightblue]Here[/color][/u][/url].\n<br />\n<br />Whirligig Sentry can be found [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/23331][u][color=lightblue]Here[/color][/u][/url].\n<br />\n<br />Alien Disruptor can be found [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/19037][u][color=lightblue]Here[/color][/u][/url].\n<br />\n<br />Settlement Radar Station &amp; Drone Defenders can be found [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/30665][u][color=lightblue]Here[/color][/u][/url].\n<br />\n<br />Settlement Medic Bot: \"Mister Medic\" can be found [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/37655][u][color=lightblue]Here[/color][/u][/url].\n<br />\n<br />Settlement Police Bot: \"Mister Law\" can be found [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/37730][u][color=lightblue]Here[/color][/u][/url].\n<br />\n<br />Settlement Repair Bot: \"Mister Mechanic\" can be found [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/37933][u][color=lightblue]Here[/color][/u][/url].\n<br />\n<br />Settlement Salvage Bot: \"Mister Salvage\" can be found [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/32212][u][color=lightblue]Here[/color][/u][/url].\n<br />\n<br />Settlement Gardener Bot: \"Mister Gardener\" can be found [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/38281][u][color=lightblue]Here[/color][/u][/url].\n<br />\n<br />Settlement Delivery Bots: \"Mister Caravan / Mister Express / Mister Postman\" can be found [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/41657][u][color=lightblue]Here[/color][/u][/url].\n<br />\n<br />Carry-Your-Stuff Robots can be found [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/47892][u][color=lightblue]Here[/color][/u][/url].\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=lightgreen]In Memoriam:[/color][/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />In memory of my Father (may he Rest In Peace) who was a model airplane maker (gliders &amp; gas powered) and an RC enthusiast. \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][color=lightblue]Enjoy![/color][/size][/b]",

A few guides for the most common tasks can be found in the articles section of this page.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/40650/40650-1587550218-801393958.png[/img]\n<br />[u][b][color=#00ff00][size=4]Workbench[/size][/color][/b][/u]\n<br />\n<br />You can place stationary workbenches in settlements and player homes via the workshop menu, found under the Crafting category. The mobile versions can be crafted at any Chemistry Station in the CRAFTING FRAMEWORK category.\n<br />When starting a new game (upon leaving Vault 111) a single instance of the mobile Universal Workbench gets automatically added to the player's inventory. Those benches can be placed anywhere in the world by either dropping it from your inventory or using the AID items as a favourites hotkey (or MCM hotkeys). When you activate the workbench a menu appears. Every menu item can be disabled via holotape or optional MCM. Once you're done with crafting you can pack it up and transport in your inventory until you need it again.\n<br />The mobile power armor workbench works a bit different. It gets automatically packed up and send to your inventory once you leave the power armor crafting menu.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ff00][b]Menu Structure (click on Show to expand)[/b][/color]\n<br />[spoiler][list=1]\n<br />[*]Exit Menu\n<br />[*]Pack Up Workbench (only on the mobile version)\n<br />[*]Armor - Create\n<br />[*]Armor - Modify\n<br />[*]Weapon - Create\n<br />[*]Weapon - Modify\n<br />[*]Ammo Station\n<br />[*]Chem Station\n<br />[*]Junk Station\n<br />[*]Utility Station\n<br />[*]Cooking Stove\n<br />[/list][/spoiler]\n<br />[u][b][color=#00ff00][size=4]Equipment Modification[/size][/color][/b][/u]\n<br />\n<br />Crafting Framework uses the vanilla legendary slot as an entry point for its mechanics and functionality. Because of that, the mod is able to modify all kind of equipment without requiring patches for other mods or Creation Club content. Getting this feature up and running is simple:\n<br />[list=1]\n<br />[*]Go to a workbench of your choice and choose any kind of legendary mod option (even \"No Legendary Effect\" works here).\n<br />[*]This adds the main mod slot \"Legendary Enhancements\" which lets you pick and choose which additions you want to add to the item.\n<br />[*]Once you've selected one of the options new mod slots will be added to the item that hold a bunch of additional modifications for you to utilise.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />All the modifiers (damage, protection, recoil, etc.) aren't meant to be used as an additional progression system but rather tools to balance your items. In case you're applying a second legendary mod be aware that those effects won't show a legendary mod description but the effects will still apply.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#00ff00]Menu Structure (click on Show to expand):[/color][/b]\n<br />[spoiler][code]L1: Legendary Mod Slot\n<br />├─ UO: Unscrappable Option\n<br />└─ LE: Legendary Enhancements\n<br />   ├─ Armor Options\n<br />   │   ├─ AE: Armor Enhancement\n<br />   │   ├─ PM: Protection Modifier\n<br />   │   └─ JM: Jump Height Modifier\n<br />   ├─ Power Armor Options\n<br />   │   ├─ MA: Second Material\n<br />   │   ├─ MI: Second Misc\n<br />   │   ├─ PM: Protection Modifier\n<br />   │   └─ JM: Jump Height Modifier\n<br />   ├─ Gun Options\n<br />   │   ├─ AC: Ammo Conversion\n<br />   │﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿   ├─ PO: Projectile Override\n<br />   │   ├─ FM: Firing Mode\n<br />   │   ├─ ROF: Rate of Fire Modifier\n<br />   │   ├─ AM: Accuracy Modifier\n<br />   │   ├─ RM: Recoil Modifier\n<br />   │   ├─ RaM: Range Modifier\n<br />   │   ├─ RS: Reload Speed Modifier\n<br />   │   ├─ ZM: Zoom Modifier\n<br />   │   ├─ STM: Sighted Transition Modifier\n<br />   │   └─ DM: Damage Modifier\n<br />   ├─ Melee Options\n<br />   │   ├─ ME: Melee Enhancement\n<br />   │   └─ DM: Damage Modifier\n<br />   └─ Second Legendary\n<br />        └─ L2: Legendary Mod Slot\n<br />[/code][/spoiler]\n<br />[color=#00ff00][b]Different ways of crafting and swapping legendary effects[/b][/color]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]The easiest and most natural way of utilising legendary effects is by acquiring legendary items from enemies or other sources. Go to the workbench with them and remove the legendary effect by selecting \"No Legendary Effect\" in the menu. This will add the effect as a loose mod to your inventory. And that loose mod with its effect can be applied to other items you have without any requirement.\n<br />[*]The second and more advanced way is by scrapping legendary items (items which have a legendary mod applied). You'll receive \"Legendary Microchips\" for that process. They can be used to craft any legendary effect the mod has to offer, provided you meet the requirements (amount of Legendary Microchips and perks).\n<br />[*]There's an optional plugin in the \"Expansionsand Patches\" pack/download that adds Microchips to several chests/trunks/safes.\n<br />\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/40650/40650-1587550212-1118533145.png[/img]\n<br />You can configure and customize the mod to your liking. There are two ways to do that directly in-game.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#00ff00]Holotape[/color][/b]\n<br />The holotape gets added to the player's inventory when starting the game for the first time after installing the mod given that you already left Vault 111. It can also be crafted at the Utility Station under the \"Crafting Framework\" section. All the available options have descriptions. Tweak available slots, recipes, inject the new legendary effects into the game's legendary loot pool, tweak microchip returns when scrapping legendaries, etc.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#00ff00]Mod Configuration Menu (optional)[/color][/b]\n<br />This is optional. The MCM configuration becomes available as soon as you install [url=http://f4se.silverlock.org/]Fallout 4 Script Extender (F4SE)[/url] and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/21497]Mod Configuration Menu[/url]. This menu sports exactly the same options as those in the holotape plus two hotkey options that make the \"drop workbench\" items obsolete.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/40650/40650-1595604234-1314529199.png[/img]\n<br />This is a xEdit script that automatically scans your installed mods for crafting recipes and adds them to Crafting Framework's multi-functional workbench. You may patch only a few mods or your entire load order. You'll no longer have a cluttered Chemistry Station with lots of different armour, weapon, ammo or other random recipes. You can even let the script include recipes made for other custom benches, e.g. the ones from AWKCR.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#00ff00]Usage Instructions[/color][/b]\n<br />[list=1]\n<br />[*]Install Crafting Framework, [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/2737]FO4Edit[/url]﻿ and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/68617]MXPF[/url]﻿.\n<br />[*]Download the Workbench Patcher archive on this page and extract its content into your FO4Edit root folder.\n<br />[*]Stay in that folder and run [i]CF_WorkbenchPatcher.bat[/i]. When all required files are in place you can hit Y and Enter to continue.\n<br />[*]In FO4Edit's plugin selection keep your entire load order selected and hit OK.\n<br />[*]Wait for the loading process to be finished and a menu will appear. In this menu, you can hover over the options to get a tooltip with additional information.\n<br />[*]Start the patching process. If that's the first time you're creating a patch the script will ask you for a plugin name.\n<br />[*]Afterwards, you can select the plugins you want to be included in the patch.\n<br />[*]Follow the instructions and wait until the message box says [i]Patching Complete[/i].\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/40650/40650-1595605248-326221847.png[/img]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/articles/1979]FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions[/url]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/articles/1980]Compatibility - Crafting Framework and other Mods in Detail[/url]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/articles/1985]Switching from another legendary crafting mod to Crafting Framework mid-playthrough[/url]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/articles/1981]Guide: Adding Crafting Framework support to custom legendary effects[/url]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/articles/1982]Guide: Adding legendary attachment points to items[/url]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/articles/1983]Guide: Tweak Crafting Framework's slot and recipe visibility independent of savegames or playthroughs[/url]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/articles/2320]Guide: Identifying duplicate recipes from other plugins that interact with Crafting Framework's legendary effects[/url]\n<br />[*]﻿[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/articles/2351]Guide: Adding new workbenches (modes) to the Universal Workbench[/url]\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/40650/40650-1595605252-380620919.png[/img]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/40919]Armor and Clothing Overhaul[/url]: If you want to use CF's functionality with clothing but don't want to use Armorsmith Extended or Unified Clothing Overhaul (UCO) check this out.

                "description": "Requires base game only\n<br />[center][u][b]\n<br />[size=4]Description[/size][/b][/u][/center]\n<br />Raiders wear a greater variety of clothing, are a little tougher, and drop fewer stimpaks. All with base game equipment. \n<br />\n<br />[u][b][center][size=4]Details[/size][/center][/b][/u]\n<br />I added a few SPECIAL points to ClassRaider. In particular 4 points of Endurance, since otherwise raiders don't get any. I also added 15 points of bonus damage resist to ClassRaider. This makes raiders a little more durable without changing their equipment stats.\n<br />\n<br />I edited the leveled lists that determine a raider's underarmor and headgear. Adding some appropriate outfits. They still primarily spawn with vanilla items, but you might see a raider with civilian clothes. Some clothing will not appear until you meet higher level raiders. There should also be fewer raiders with full armor in early game, but more in late game.\n<br />\n<br />I edited the leveled list that determines what items spawn on death. Unchanged you might get brass knuckles or a stimpack. Now you might get 0-5 items. Some low quality food, junk or jet. Mostly junk. This will greatly reduce the number of stimpaks you collect in a game considering how many raiders you typically encounter. However some raiders spawn with stimpaks to use in combat, so you might still find them if you are stealthy or quick to kill them.\n<br />\n<br />1.4 Adds a rare \"raider chemist\" with special gear. They are part of the legendary raider pool (but I don't believe they drop legendary equip) and should show up after level 25. Hard to play test, but should add an appropriate risk/reward factor as well as adding more flavor to raiders.\n<br />I've also updated the mod to AWKCR 6.0+ keywords.\n<br />[center][u][size=4][b]\n<br />Optional/Experimental[/b][/size][/u][/center]\n<br />I added an optional file that is just the LLD_raider leveled list that determines what spawns on raiders when they die. If you just want that, there you go. I also made a duplicate of the main file, only with the change that on spawn, raiders will have different body shapes (exactly like the bodyslide triangle in player gen at the start of the game). Even if it doesn't cause compatibility issues, the results can be a bit off so I'm just putting it out there if people want chunky raiders.\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][b][u][center]Goal[/center][/u][/b][/size]\n<br />I imagine raiders as being desperate and disorganized, yet at the same time hardened by circumstance. Some are settlers or scavengers still wearing whatever they could scrap together, rather than all wearing the same four outfits. They don't have good equipment or medical supplies. Barely scraping by and desperate enough to do anything to get through the next day. Game play wise I just got sick of finding a stimpack on every other dead raider.\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][u][b][center]Compatibility[/center][/b][/u][/size]\n<br />Raider Overhaul changes everything that this does, so they are not compatible. At best you can load my LLD_raider file after and it shouldn't cause problems. I didn't touch weapon or armor lists (other than underarmor and headgear) so mods that give raiders weapons should be fine. Mods that add new raider faces should also be fine. I'm using [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/15780/?]Varied Raiders[/url] and not having issues.\n<br />Version 1.3 and beyond changes stats on two base game gasmasks so that they can be worn with hats/helmets. I will add a compatibility version for AWKCR.",

It has two modes, timer (default) and distance. Because we have no MCM yet for Fallout, you will have to update and change its settings through the console. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ve made it easy.

This mode is the default. Note that pulling the core before the shut down sound finishes, causes the shut down sound to stop. See the settings section for more info if you are using shorter animations or longer sounds, and you wish to hear it t\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]s_Ix1vOV3iQ[/youtube][/quote][quote][b][u][color=#f1c232][size=5]Distance Mode[/size][/color][/u][/b]\r<br />\r<br />Gives you the cores from the power armour after you walk X meters away from the frame. This allows you to keep the core in while staying nearby to do your charisma checks or whatever, and hopping back in without having to reinsert. Or if you are Eric and apparently constantly just accidentally jump out of your armor on accident. Honestly depending on feedback distance mode will probably become the default in future versions.\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]HI0gox4KNZA[/youtube][/quote][b][color=#e06666][size=6][u]\r<br />Settings[/u][/size][/color][/b]\r<br />\r<br />Because we have no MCM all settings are done through changing variables from the console.

Select 'Yes to All' when asked to overwrite\n<br />Enjoy!\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][center][/center][/size][color=#cc4125]Known issues:[/color]\n<br />\n<br />regarding the raider skins, if you are using the new thong skins the raiders will appear to be wearing transparent thongs as well!\n<br />\n<br />this is due to Bethesda using the same normal map for the raiders and player/female characters, hopefully they will patch this soon so raiders can have a unique normalmap!\n<br />\n<br />as of v3.5 the NN installer now includes an optional tiny .esp plugin to let raiders have a unique normalmap to fix the issue.\n<br />\n<br />CBBE backhead fix:\n<br />\n<br />cbbe uses separate textures called femalebhed_d.dds and femalebhed_s.dds in order to fix a backhead texture issue. Nuclear nude does not replace these files by default (since it would increase filesize considerately) but you may experience a small seam/lighting issue in the backhead area when using some skins (or missing backhead tattoos on phoenix skins). \n<br />\n<br />the current solution is:\n<br />download the vanilla 'NUCLEAR Nude Main Skins MANUAL Install Files', \n<br />extract the skin that matches your currently installed cbbe skin\n<br />rename the file 'femalebody_d.dds' to 'femalebhed_d.dds'\n<br />rename the file 'femalebody_s.dds' to 'femalebhed_s.dds' \n<br />copy both of those files to Fallout 4/data/textures/actors/character/basehumanfemale/ and overwrite\n<br />\n<br />[color=#cc4125]How to uninstall:[/color]\n<br />\n<br />If you use NMM, simply right-click the mod and select 'Uninstall Mod'\n<br />\n<br />[i]manual uninstall:[/i]\n<br />\n<br />1. Navigate to &#92;Fallout 4&#92;Data&#92;textures&#92;actors&#92;character&#92;basehumanfemale&#92;\n<br />\n<br />2. For the skin - delete the files: \n<br />femalebody_d.dds, femalebody_s.dds, femalebody_n.dds, BaseFemaleHands_d.dds, BaseFemaleHands_s.dds\n<br />\n<br />3. For Raiders - delete the files: \n<br />FemaleBodyDirty_d.dds, FemaleBodyDirty_s.dds, FemaleBodyDirty_n.dds, BaseFemaleHandsDirty_d.dds, BaseFemaleHandsDirty_s.dds\n<br />\n<br />That's it\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][b][color=#d9ead3]Mini screenshot guide &amp; tips:[/color][/b][/size]\n<br />\n<br />1. look for a nice spot with good dynamic lighting and make sure you are in 3rd person view\n<br />2. open the console\n<br />3. type 'tfc 1' - this will enable free moving camera and pause all action\n<br />4. type 'sucsm 1' - this controls the speed of the free camera and brings it to a level where you can make good adjustments\n<br />5. optionally you can change the field of view with the command 'fov xx' where xx is the fov (ex 'fov 70')\n<br />6. close the console and use the controls to find a nice angle for a screenshot\n<br />7. when you found a good spot, open the console again\n<br />8. type 'tm' - this will hide all user interface and lock your current view, including the console so be warned! it is still active even tho you can't see it!\n<br />9. take screenshot by hitting print screen key\n<br />10. type 'tm' again to unhide the user interface - if you by accident closed the console, just hit the open console key and type 'tm'\n<br />11. type 'tfc' to return to normal game camera mode\n<br />12. your screenshot is saved in your fallout 4 game installation folder!\n<br />\n<br />Happy snapping!\n<br />\n<br />[center][/center]\n<br />[center][color=#ffa500][size=4][i]Recommended mods:[/i][/size][/color][/center]\n<br />\n<br />[center][size=4][b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/21248/?][color=#ffa07a]Unique NPCs - An Overhaul of the Commonwealth[/color][/url][/b]\n<br />[b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/12309/?][color=#ffa07a]Juicy Natural CBBE Bodyslide Preset[/color][/url][/b]\n<br />[b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/8126/?][color=#ffa07a]Ponytail Hairstyles by Azar[/color][/url][/b]\n<br />[b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/1369/?][color=#ffa07a]Wasteland Salon[/color][/url][/b]\n<br />[b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/169/?][color=#ffa07a]FCO - HD Eyes[/color][/url][/b]\n<br />[b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/819/?][color=#ffa07a]Eye Normal Map Fix[/color][/url][/b]\n<br />[b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/2227/?][color=#ffa07a]Harness Wardrobe - Craftable Variants and Replacers[/color][/url][/b]\n<br />[b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/14893/?][color=#ffa07a]Less intense grime[/color][/url][/b]\n<br />[b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/15084/?][color=#ffa07a]Hek-Ya Jane Body Presets Collection[/color][/url][/b]\n<br />[b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/19466/?][color=#ffa07a]Unique Female NPC Bodies | CBBE Body and Skin Overhaul[/color][/url][/b]\n<br />[b][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/21683/?][color=#ffa07a]Athletic Beauty Bodyslide Preset[/color][/url][/b][/size][/center]\n<br />\n<br />[center][u][size=3][b][b][b][img]http://i.imgur.com/aH5JJUK.png[/img]\n<br />[/b][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[/b][/size][/u][/center][center][u][size=3]Like the mod?[/size][/u]\n<br />[b]Consider using the [/b][color=#93c47d]Endorse[/color][b] function or leave a comment![/b]\n<br />[b]Any feedback &amp; suggestions are welcome![/b]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[u][size=3]Donations[/size][/u]\n<br />[b]Donations are appreciated and serve as a great encouragement for mod authors![/b]\n<br />[b]- a big thank you to all who have already donated![/b]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2]How?[/size]\n<br />[b]Nexus has a build in donation system[/b]\n<br />[b]use the button on the top right of any mod page.[/b]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.patreon.com/zentreon][img]http://i.imgur.com/9RB2YVl.png[/img][/url]\n<br />\n<br />[b]Become a 'Harbinger of the Apocalypse'\n<br />Any contribution will be converted into pixels!\n<br />[/b](no special mod related services or benefits will be offered, all modding efforts will always be free)\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[u][size=3][b]Special Thanks to[/b][/size][/u]\n<br />\n<br />Bethesda for making a beautiful Fallout game!\n<br />matt3000 for creating a great nipple bodymesh!\n<br />OniNigma for permission to use enhanced perky bodymesh!\n<br />RexHarbinger for work on Shaggy skin!\n<br />Wolrajh for conversion of Vanilla Nuclear skins to CBBE!\n<br />Caliente for making the excellent CBBE mod!\n<br />Nightasy for making the amazing Jane Bod mod!\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]check out my other mods: \n<br />[/size]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16104][img]https://i.imgur.com/DFBgs7d.png[/img][/url]﻿\n<br />[b]Female UNP Skin for Skyrim (SE)﻿[/b]\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/14269/?][img]http://i.imgur.com/DLaJUMF.png[/img][/url]\n<br />[b]Lustrous skins for the Jane Bod[/b]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/13422/?][img]http://i.imgur.com/LLn8qhl.png[/img][/url]\n<br />[b]maybe you're a synth, maybe not..[/b]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/595/?][size=4]\n<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/z2HlCye.png[/img][/size][/url][/center][center][/center]\n<br />[center][/center]\n<br />\n<br />[center][img]http://i.imgur.com/Be9J3EW.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][b]Have fun and enjoy the apocalypse!\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[/b][/size][/center]",

The primary difference is that my code will work with anything Archive2 does, not just Fallout 4 while also avoiding folder permissions altogether. This is because Shambles1980's bat works with TOP and Fallout 4's internal Data folder making the install even easier than mine and you don't have to touch Archive2 because it does that step for you.",

                "description": "This mod is primarily a fix for a problem with Sim Settlements, and other incredibly script heavy mods. However, many people have reported increased stability and performance with it, so feel free to try it for yourself. Having a larger sample size to report their experience with it can't hurt anything.\n<br />\n<br />The plugin is version independent and should work with any version of Fallout 4 that has an [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/47327]Address Library[/url] available.\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]FAQ:[/size]\n<br />Q: What's the problem Sim Settlements causes?\n<br />A: The game allocates ~70mb of memory when reading script properties and normally that's more than enough for the vanilla game, but Sim Settlements eats a ton of that, and with too many city plans, the game won't load saves anymore. This plugin doubles, triples, or quadruples that memory allocation to ~130mb, ~200mb, or ~270mb.\n<br />\n<br />Q: Will this mod help with x, or fix x?\n<br />A: I don't know, maybe? This patch will affect many things, and I don't know the full of extent of what it'll affect, and whether it'll cause problems or fix existing ones. Let me know how it works for you, if there are problems I can look into them, and if there aren't- that's great.\n<br />\n<br />Q: Source?\n<br />[url=https://github.com/shad0wshayd3/BakaScrapHeap]GitHub[/url].",

There should be no reason to run more than one of any given item simultaneously, and the corresponding logic is coded to catch this, in order to help prevent potential issues.\r<br />\r<br />Activating a tool will &#34;consume&#34; it but then return another almost immediately afterward.\r<br />Then, the corresponding script will then search the area in a radius roughly equal to what can be chosen from the holotape.\r<br />These values are very loose approximations, and were formed from documentation for the Skyrim version of the Creation Kit; they should still be suitable, but don&#39;t rely on them for any sort of precision.\r<br />\r<br />A notification will appear in the corner of the screen indicating the progress of various collection routines within the given radius.\r<br />Then, each appropriate item will be processed, and anything yielded will eventually make its way to the user.\r<br />The transfer interface for a container may open to show some collected items, depending on the tool used, but no items can be put into it or taken out from it - just close this and the items will be added.\r<br />\r<br />The configuration holotape supports various options for each tool added, including configuring the harvester to harvest flora, or to harvest corpses as well.\r<br />The items on any corpse within the harvesting radius will be pooled and presented to the player in the same manner as other yielded items.\r<br />Additionally, the holotape supports running both flora and corpse harvesting &#34;at the same time&#34;.\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]This will in reality run first the flora harvesting and then the corpse harvesting back-to-back, saving the user from having to change the configuration every time if they want to use all features from this mod.\r<br />[/list]Flora harvesting can be set to ignore or enforce a requirement that flora not be harvested if that would be stealing for the user; the default behavior is to ignore this requirement.\r<br />Corpse harvesting can be set to ignore or enforce a requirement that the actor in question have been killed by the user; the default behavior is to ignore this requirement.\r<br />\r<br />The Junk Vacuum will always collect loose items lying in the world around the player, and uses its own, separate radius.\r<br />The Junk Vacuum can be configured to either process or ignore items considered stealing for the user, or even to strip ownership information.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#b6d7a8][size=4][b]Compatibility[/b][/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />This doesn&#39;t alter anything from the base game, so it should be fairly compatible with most mods.\r<br />As such, the load order shouldn&#39;t matter too much, but any optional patches will of course need to be below both the base plugin for this mod and the DLC/mod agains which the compatibility patch should run. For example, something like this:\r<br />Fallout4.esm\r<br />[...other DLC...]\r<br />DLCCoast.esm\r<br />[...other DLC...]\r<br />[...other ESMs...]\r<br />Homemaker.esm\r<br />[...other ESMs...]\r<br />[...other ESPs...]\r<br />Rdr-Harvesting.esp\r<br />Rdr-Harvesting-DLCCoast.esp\r<br />Rdr-Harvesting-Homemaker.esp\r<br />[...other ESPs...]\r<br />\r<br />Any mod that adds custom flora or junk items won&#39;t work without a patch.\r<br />If you have a mod that you really want added you can add a comment or PM me and I can have a look, or you can just make your own patch that adds the new flora to the form list of flora from the base plugin file.\r<br />Any mod that changes the ingestible yielded by pre-existing flora records should work, however, provided that it is against the same flora base object and loads before this mod.\r<br />\r<br />This should be compatible with most mods that add new NPCs, provided that they use the keywords shared by other NPCs in the game.\r<br />Custom races may possibly introduce problems with being harvested, however, though the scripting tries fairly hard to find all valid corpses.\r<br />\r<br />This mod is compatible with the [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/4397]Graygarden Planters - Quest Reward[/url] mod, without any patch being necessary, as tested with version 0.3.0 of that mod.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#b6d7a8][size=4][b]Disclaimers[/b][/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />Try to be gentle with the scripts; I tried to account for most situations, but some activities might cause some trouble, like the following:\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]Fast-travelling away from the activation area immediately after using the item\r<br />[*]Spam-activating multiple tools within a very short period of time, or quickly changing the harvesting radius between these\r<br />[*]Trying to coerce actors other than the player into using the tools; while the scripts were written the be agnostic to whoever used it, this has not been tested\r<br />[*]Installing/uninstalling the mod or DLC plugins, or saving and exiting, while the tools are running; saving and exiting should work, but is not recommended (especially between updating the mod)\r<br />[/list]\r<br />The harvester should never take very long to finish, and if it does then something has probably gone wrong; corpses may take longer though.\r<br />You may want to consider saving before each activation, because I had some early issues in testing with the game freezing after collecting from larger numbers of harvestables.\r<br />\r<br />This mod has had some light testing to ensure that it functions as expected, but keep in mind that this is just an early release and bugs are very possible.\r<br />Please send any suggestions/bug reports my way, and I will do my best to address them.\r<br />\r<br />Try not to travel too far too quickly while the harvester is running; it uses an invisible container to give items to the player, and if this is inaccessible at just the right moment the mod may have unpredictable behavior.\r<br />\r<br />The usual warnings for mods apply - I am not responsible for anything bad that may happen to your saves/game/computer/etc., use at your own risk, ...\r<br />\r<br />Please do not upload this elsewhere.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#b6d7a8][size=4][b]Plans[/b][/size][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*][s]Looking into adding rudimentary support for junk collection.[/s] Done&#33; Introduced in V0.3.0 (2016-07-19)\r<br />[*][s]Generalize harvesting script to allow for items that aren&#39;t strictly flora, or in corpses.[/s] Done&#33; Introduced, with just Mirelurk Eggs to start, in V0.2.2 (2016-06-30)\r<br />[*][s]Looking into adding experimental support for corpses.[/s] Done&#33; Introduced in V0.2.0 (2016-06-30)\r<br />[/list][center]\r<br />My Fallout 4 mods:\r<br />[list]\r<br />[*]Collection Tools\r<br />[/list][list]\r<br />[*][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/17043]Settlement Equipment[/url]\r<br />[/list][list]\r<br />[*][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/20367]Curie Romance Dialogue Fix[/url]\r<br />[/list][/center]",

With a high enough Settlement Happiness rating (usually above 80), settlers will occasionally give you gifts when they express their thanks. For example, when they say, \"We just wanted to say how grateful we are for the opportunity\", there is a chance they will give you a gift of crops, medicinal items, ammo, or small shipments of certain building materials.\n2) Updated SCDO to conform with changes from the December 2020 version of Unofficial Fallout 4 Patch (that mod is not required for this). That mod makes lots of grammar edits to vanilla lines with each update it does, so now SCDO conforms with the latest batch of changes from that mod.\n3) In COMDanse, the following Danse lines that compliment the player right after combat finishes will now only be said after the quest \"Call to Arms\" (at Arc Jet Systems), because Danse wouldn't likely feel enough admiration for the player before then to say the following lines:\n\"You're one hell of a soldier, you know that?\"\n\"I feel better knowing you have my back.\"\n\"I have to admit, I'm very impressed. You're quite a soldier.\"\n\"It's a pleasure to be a part of a team you can depend on.\"\n\"You were born to be a soldier.\"\n\"I have to admit, I feel pretty damn secure when you've got my back.\"\n4) In DialogueFarmGeneric, adjusted conditions on \"Didn't expect help from a stranger. Thanks\" and \"Hey, thanks for your help\" so that only appropriate NPC's say it.\n5) In DialogueGoodneighborGuards, adjusted the following highly-specific dialogue lines so instead of repeating every few minutes, they are only said once:\n- \"Might stop by the Memory Den later. There was this girl, few months ago? Man oh man, wouldn't mind seein' those curves again.\"\n- \"The Memory Den's great, just don't get hooked like old Kent. Poor bastard's practically stuck in the past.\"\n- \"Fred Allen at the Hotel Rexford, he can hook you up with chems. Irma at the Memory Den... she offers a whole other class of drug.\"\n- \"So not only is Diamond City's mayor dead... turns out he was a synth all along. And they say Goodneighbor's crazy...\"\n- \"You know who kicked the Ghouls out of Diamond City, right? That blowhard, Mayor McDonough. He'll get his one day, you watch.\"",

Now she'll only ever say that line once, and at the right time. Same with comments about looting, crafting, chem use, etc.\n<br />\n<br />2) Adds new situation-appropriate dialogue for companions. They'll have more to say and seem more aware of their surroundings.\n<br />\n<br />3) New dialogue menu options for Cait, Curie, Piper, Valentine, Hancock, Danse, Deacon, and Gage. They all give side quests now, except Curie, who can serve as a vendor and combat medic once she's converted to a synth.\n<br />\n<br />4) Generic vanilla settler dialogue now pulls from a bank of over 150 lines instead of just 21, multiplied by up to 10 different potential voice types for each line.\n<br />\n<br />5) Settlers are aware of your quest progression, and while they still occasionally complain about \"my back hurts, my feet hurt...\", they display increased awareness of the dangers lurking in the Commonwealth, expressing gratitude for the protection you've provided them, with a more tolerable balance between positive, neutral, negative, and snarky comments. If your settlement happiness is high enough, they will occasionally give you small gifts when expressing their gratitude.\n<br />\n<br />6) Adds additional combat dialogue variety to Raiders and Gunners.\n<br />\n<br />In total, the mod adds over 2,300 voice lines to companions, settlers, and enemies. \n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ff00][b][u]How it works[/u][/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />This was accomplished with vanilla dialogue by:\n<br />\n<br />[color=#9fc5e8][color=#ea9999]- Incorporating content that was cut from the game[/color]\n<br />[color=#b6d7a8]- Editing and splicing existing lines to create new ones[/color]\n<br />- Re-purposing hidden or rare dialogue to apply to new situations\n<br />[color=#b4a7d6]- Flagging certain annoying/repetitive lines to only be said once (e.g. loot junk comments)[/color]\n<br />[color=#ffe599]- Adding cool-down timers to other repetitive lines (e.g. combat taunts)[/color][/color]\n<br />\n<br />No NPC records were edited - only companion dialogue quest records and the 'DialogueFarmGeneric' quest (for settlers). No vanilla scripts were touched. NPC appearance mods are fully compatible, as are mods that affect NPC stats, NPC leveled lists, and companion affinity.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ff00][b][u]Companions[/u][/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Companion dialogue diversity is only as good as the most repeated line. Piper has over two-thousand lines, but you hear only a small fraction of those on a typical play-through. Some of her wittiest lines trigger only if she's with you on a particular quest, while some of her combat lines she says dozens of times.\n<br />\n<br />I've traveled with Piper over 200 hours. Sorting through the raw audio files to make this mod, I was shocked to find hundreds of lines I'd never heard her say before.\n<br />\n<br />A lot of us travel with companions for as long as they're interesting and not annoying. When they start repeating the same lines over and over, we lose interest and dismiss them. With this mod, that happens much later into the game.\n<br />\n<br />The companion dialogue that is added here doesn't change their characters. It's the same companions you're used to, just with more content. Specifically:\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ffff][color=#00ff00]- Triple the amount of general combat lines (detect enemy, taunt enemy, victory line) for Cait, Curie, Piper, Valentine, Hancock, Danse, Deacon, and Gage.[/color]\n<br />\n<br />- Lots of new random idles, especially in dungeons, and sometimes with a sarcastic slant if it suits the character.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffff00]- Certain vanilla random idles that tend to repeat often will now only be said once.[/color]\n<br />[color=#1e84cc]\n<br />- When you loot, pick a lock, hack a terminal, use a workbench, take drugs, eat a corpse, walk around naked, enter power armor, etc., your companion will comment, but they will never repeat that same comment again.[/color][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[center]﻿[youtube]TXVtZTQTRiI[/youtube][/center][color=#00ffff][u][color=#00ff00][b][u]Settlers[/u][/b][/color][/u][/color]\n<br />\n<br />I was trying to figure out why I lost interest in settlement building about 6 months after the game launched. The settlement mods that have released since then are incredible. Why am I not motivated to engage with that part of the game anymore?\n<br />\n<br />Partly because it doesn't feel like my actions matter. Not only does the game not in any way react to the massive colony I've built on Spectacle Island, the settlers there don't care either. They're still complaining about the same old things.\n<br />\n<br />I wanted the game to feel like the settlers were on the same team as me, functioning as more than professional mooches. If I'm General of the Minutemen, call me \"General\" once in a while, and talk to me about tactical stuff. Acknowledge the threats we face and the things we're doing to solve problems. Or barring that, at least be semi-interesting and make me laugh occasionally.\n<br />\n<br />So that's what I tried to implement via more dialogue lines, much of it conditioned upon what's going on in the game and/or the settlement. The increased variety in settler dialogue only occurs if a settlement's happiness is above 60, and some of the lines won't trigger until happiness is closer to 100.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ff00][b][u]Raiders and Gunners[/u][/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Raider and Gunner combat lines have been tweaked to make them sound a little smarter, and to increase variety. This was done by adding lines (over 130) from cut content, DLC, and re-purposing voice files from quests where lines are only said once in specific areas (e.g. Museum of Freedom, Combat Zone, Cabot quest line).\n<br />\n<br />The new lines are general in nature, not location specific, and it's stuff like: \"You're goin' nowhere\", \"C'mon, I got places to be!\", \"Get it over with and die already!\", \"God dammit! You're gonna regret ever comin' here!\", etc. It sounds indistinguishable from the vanilla combat, there's just more of it. \n<br />\n<br />Also, Raiders won't call you \"Rookie\" once you're not a rookie anymore, and several of the lines that make Raiders sound comically obtuse have been flagged as \"say once\": e.g.  \"Hiding? From me? Not even possible...\"\", \"What the...!? No, no, it's nothing..\" Raiders will still sound dumb, saying lines like \"Huh?\", Wha?\", \"What the...\", but it won't be quite as over-the-top as it is in the vanilla game.\n<br />\n<br />When stalking Gunners, they'll no longer say a few of the lines that make them sound incompetent: e.g. \"Huh?\" \"Wha?\", so it feels more like you're encountering trained mercenaries instead of dumb Raiders.\n<br />\n<br />[left][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/41785/41785-1575190586-1130611822.png[/img]﻿[/left][center][/center][color=#00ff00][b][u]Quests[/u][/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Certain companions give repeatable quests now:\n<br />\n<br />- Piper gives you the quests \"[color=#93c47d]Anything for a Story[/color]\" to explore places you haven't cleared yet and \"[color=#93c47d]You Can't Stop the Press[/color]\" to gather supplies for her newspaper business.\n<br />\n<br />- Cait offers a quest \"[color=#93c47d]Lookin' for Trouble[/color]\" to hunt down those Raiders she talks so much about hating.\n<br />\n<br />- Danse assigns you the quest \"[color=#93c47d]Outstanding, Soldier![/color]\" to eliminate Super Mutants and Feral Ghouls.\n<br />\n<br />- Hancock has a quest \"[color=#93c47d]Because I Got High[/color]\" to track down chem stashes.\n<br />\n<br />- Nick gives the quests \"[color=#93c47d]Lost and Found[/color]\" to track down stolen property for Diamond City residents and \"[color=#93c47d]Commonwealth Justice[/color]\" to complete bounties on behalf of the Diamond City Council.\n<br />\n<br />- Gage gives the quest \"[color=#93c47d]Let's Go Kill Some Sh*t[/color]\" to wipe out rival gangs.\n<br />\n<br />- Deacon also gives a non-repeatable quest called [color=#93c47d]\"Coming Clean\"[/color] once you've maxed his affinity. Ask him \"What's News?\" and cycle through all the dialogue to start the quest and experience a new chapter of his never-ending stream of B.S.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ffff][u]Radiant quests are lame[/u][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ea9999]Typical BoS/Institute quest[/color]: Talk to Quest Giver &gt; Travel to Dungeon &gt; Kill bad guys &gt; Travel to Quest Giver &gt; Talk to Quest Giver.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f6b26b]Typical Preston quest[/color]: Talk to Preston &gt; Travel to Settler &gt; Talk to Settler &gt; Travel to Dungeon &gt; Kill bad guys &gt; Travel to Settler &gt; Talk to Settler &gt; Travel to Preston &gt; Talk to Preston. \n<br />\n<br />That's a lot of talking and load screens for not much action. It's more fun when the quest giver travels with you to do the quest: Talk to Companion &gt; Travel to Dungeon &gt; Kill bad guys &gt; Talk to Companion. \n<br />\n<br />These new quests are optional, nothing is forced, and you can cancel the quest by talking to the companion. The side quests are accessed via the 'More Options' dialogue menu. Completing a quest for a companion will raise their affinity (\"like\" or \"love\" event), grant a small amount of XP, and yield caps or a custom reward. \n<br />\n<br />This gives you potentially a new way to explore the Commonwealth and discover most locations naturally without needing to do the main quest.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ffff][u]What else?[/u][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Beyond quests, this mod didn't fit well into an existing category. It's similar in spirit to [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1187]Relationship Dialogue Overhaul [/url]for Skyrim, but \"Overhaul\" typically implies something that edits a lot of things and requires a slew of patches. This has a light footprint- shouldn't require any patches. Doesn't add a new companion, or new NPC's, or conflict with any mods that alter companion/NPC appearance or stats.\n<br />\n<br />[center]﻿[youtube]gMtn-nGmTDg[/youtube][/center]\n<br />[color=#00ff00][b][u]Load Order and Compatibility[/u][/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />There are various mods that add or edit Fallout 4 dialogue. If you run one of those mods, here's where they go in load order relative to this mod (SCDO) so that it all plays nice together and you receive the benefits of both mods. \"Below\" means \"After\", and \"Above\" means \"Before\".\n<br />\n<br />[b][i][color=#f6b26b][u]Below SCDO in load order[/u][/color][/i][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/25050]Deeper Thoughts Curie[/url] - Adds some additional dialogue to Curie. Mostly redundant with SCDO installed, but will add a little extra variety to idle comments.\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/25525]Icebreaker Piper - Companion Dialogue Overhaul[/url] - Adds more dialogue to Piper. Largely redundant with SCDO unless you would like more Piper responses to specific player actions (e.g. loot junk, swim, eat corpse, pick lock, etc), and some additional greetings.\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/13717/?]Nick Valentine Romance [/url]-  Allows you to romance Nick Valentine. Load order shouldn't matter, but put it below SCDO to be safe.\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/10365]No companion junk comments[/url] - Companions never comment on looting junk at all (versus in SCDO they'll say it once). Load order shouldn't matter, but place below SCDO just in case.\n<br />\n<br />[b][i][color=#f6b26b][u]Above SCDO in load order[/u][/color][/i][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/26638]Flirty Commonwealth[/url] - Edits and adds some flirty some companion idle comments. The Raider taunts it adds play really well with this mod (no overlap).\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/14108]Immersive Generic Dialogues [/url]- Edits some settler idle comments and companion idle comments.\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/22166?]\n<br />Player Comments and Head Tracking[/url] - Edits some companion idle lines by adding player responses to them. If you place this, or its patch, below SCDO in load order, the repetition that SCDO removes from certain companion comments (e.g. Loot junk, pick lock, eat corpse, walk around naked) and idle comments (e.g. Cait's \"we'd move faster if you kept your eyes on the road and off me arse\"), will be reintroduced. For best results, do not use the unauthorized SCDO patch available for download on the Player Comments mod page.\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/4598]\n<br />Unofficial Fallout 4 Patch[/url] - Fixes typos on companion idle lines, and these fixes have been incorporated into SCDO, without requiring UF4P to be installed (although you should probably have it installed for a plethora of other reasons).\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/25972/?]\n<br />Icebreaker Settlements - Settler Dialogue Overhaul [/url]- Adds more dialogue to settlers via the 'DialogueFarmGeneric' quest. Largely redundant with SCDO. Load order shouldn't matter, but as SCDO has more variety in settler dialogue, place SCDO lower in load order to be safe.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#f6b26b][i][u]In General[/u][/i][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />As a starting point, put SCDO below your quest mods. \n<br />\n<br />Except as noted above, place SCDO [color=#00ffff]below[/color] anything else editing the [color=#ffe599]companion dialogue quests[/color]. (ComPiperTalk, ComCaitTalk, etc). If you screw up, not a big deal, the result is that you may not see 100% of the features from this mod for a particular companion if another mod is overwriting the same dialogue topic.\n<br />\n<br />You can check whether a mod edits a quest by loading all your mods in FO4Edit, clicking on the Quest records in this mod, and seeing whether any other mods edit the same Dialogue Topic within a quest (i.e. look for red and orange records when both mods are loaded in FO4Edit).\n<br />\n<br />Other than that, SCDO should be [color=#00ffff]compatible with everything unless explicitly stated otherwise.  [/color]\n<br />\n<br />Compatible with mods that edit NPC appearances, mods that edit leveled lists, mods that affect companion affinity or companion stats, multi-follower mods, Horizon, Sim Settlements/Conqueror, Start Me Up, Better Settlers, No Negative Affinity, Visible Companion Affinity, Full Dialogue Interface, Extended Dialogue Interface, Realistic Conversations, Amazing Follower Tweaks, Unlimited Companion Framework, Combat Zone Restored, Keep Both X6-88 and Porter Gage Plus Deacon, Danse Dialogue Overhaul, and the other 30,000 or so mods for Fallout 4, unless stated otherwise on the mod page.\n<br />\n<br />[center][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/41785/41785-1573848586-1768463613.png[/img]﻿﻿[/center][color=#00ff00][b][u]Requirements and Installation[/u][/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />The base game, Automatron, Nuka World, and Vault-Tec Workshop are required. No other mods are required.\n<br />\n<br />Install like any regular mod. You can use the mod at any point on an existing save game. It also works on a new save game.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ff00][b][u]Translations[/u][/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Check the Translation drop down menu at the top of the mod page for an updated list of available translations.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ff00][b][u]Troubleshooting[/u][/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />- If a companion's buy/sell vendor menu comes up empty the first time, exit the conversation and try again. If Gage isn't selling chems, dismiss him and re-recruit. \n<br />\n<br />- If Gage turns hostile in \"Open Season\", use the \"Make Gage a Companion Again\" holotape on the counter in Fizztop Grille to restore him, or craft the holotape at a chem station under \"Utility\". If you never want Gage to become hostile in the first place during \"Open Season\", use the mod [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/29192?]Keep Both X6-88 and Porter Gage Plus Deacon[/url].\n<br />\n<br />- If a companion gives a quest, but no quest comes up, it's possible you've cleared all the eligible quest locations and may need to wait for them to respawn. Try asking again, and if that doesn't work, fast travel somewhere else, wait a day or so, then ask again.\n<br />[color=#00ff00][b][u]\n<br />XBox, PlayStation?[/u][/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />PS4: not possible due to voice files. \n<br />XBox: Yes, [url=https://bethesda.net/en/mods/fallout4/mod-detail/4133638]here[/url].\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ff00][b][u]Additional dialogue for other companions?[/u][/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Cait, Curie, Piper, Valentine, and Danse were initially chosen for additional dialogue and new content based on a Discord poll asking the question, \"[color=#ffd966]Which companions do you still play with for 6 hours or more on a Fallout 4 play-through? (Check all that apply)[/color]\". There were over 100 responses, and those were the five companions people still actually use long enough for dialogue repetition to matter. And Dogmeat, but he doesn't talk. Hancock was also given additional dialogue because I like Hancock. Same with Gage, Deacon, and MacCready.\n<br />\n<br />As it stands now:\n<br />\n<br />- Companions with additional dialogue and new content: Cait, Curie, Piper, Valentine, Danse, Deacon, Hancock, Gage, and MacCready\n<br />- Companions adjusted to avoid/reduce repetitive dialogue: All of the above plus Ada, Preston, Codsworth, X6-88, and Strong.\n<br />- Companions for whom no adjustments were made: Dogmeat and Old Longfellow\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ff00][b][u]More Quest Content?[/u][/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />This mod plays nice with the following quest mods if you want another 60+ hours of Fallout 4 content:\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/35513]Depravity[/url] - (August 2019 Mod of the Month)\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/28085]Project Valkyrie[/url] - (August 2018 Mod of the Month)\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/21469]Outcasts &amp; Remnants [/url]﻿- (April 2017 Mod of the Month Runner Up)\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/16423]Fusion City Rising[/url] - (September 2016 Mod of the Month)\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/45546]Diary of a Madman[/url] - (Alternate path to Depravity's evil ending to the vanilla game)\n<br />\n<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/xrT20hp.png[/img]﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿[/center]The quest locations in this mod have very little overlap with the locations in the mods above.

                "description": "[b][size=3][color=#ff0000]If your Fallout4 game version is beta or one of previous release version (not latest) - look for right plugin version in Files section.[/color][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][center]Описание на русском ищите в разделе Статьи (Articles).[/center][/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />This F4SE plugin allows building and placing objects in workshop mode everywhere (see note below) you want. Inside other objects, in water, even at air. Also makes almost all scrap-only objects (yellow) selectable/movable. Also you can move objects out of green zone and leave them there, while I do not recommend do this - if you think your settlement borders are too tight, just use border expanding mods like [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/3528/?]Build High[/url] (be careful though, as that mod conflicts with scrap mods and can cause reset bug).\n<br />\n<br />Allowing building in water has a side effect - all objects which requires water to be placed in, now can be build/placed everywhere also.\n<br />Put water-purifiers everywhere!\n<br />\n<br />You can [color=#00ff00][size=5]move workshop workbenches, power armors [/size][/color]and pretty much many other, previously unmovable objects (by default this mode is off - press INS to enable). Be careful, though, [color=#ff0000][size=4]save before moving/deleting such objects![/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Build restrictions (only in dirt, out of green zone) still there. The only problem is that objects with such restrictions (and all if outside workshop) will still be highlighted as able to build, but in fact they are not. You just have to remember - no building outside of green zone and if object says it has to be build in dirt, then so be it. You can build such objects in valid place first, then move them anywhere your like.\n<br />\n<br />You can toggle on/off out-of-workshop-zone timeout, so you can move built objects from your settlement as far as you like. Though, I'm not sure if placing settlement objects outside of settlement will not cause any issues, so do it on your own risk\n<br />\n<br />You can precise rotate objects by X, Y and Z axis via mouse buttons (default) or mouse wheel (see config option). Tapping ctrl key changes rotation axis. Numpad + and - changes rotation angle step.\n<br />You can precise move objects by X, Y and Z axis via numpad keys. 2,8 - up and down, 4,6 - left and right, 7,9 - to and from player. Numpad / and * changes movement step.\n<br />You can change scale of objects via numpad keys. 1 - scale down, 3 - scale up, . (dot) - reset scale to 100%. PgUp and PgDown changes scale step.\n<br />\n<br />You can make movable objects like armor, weapons, junk, e.t.c static (kannot be kicked and don't fall) and back.

This system also shoehorned most dialogue into one of four types: Yes, No, Neutral and Question. As you might imagine, dialogue doesn't always fall neatly into these categories!\n<br />\n<br />The [b]Extended Dialogue Interface[/b] ([b]XDI[/b]) is a community framework that removes the hardcoded 4-option limit on dialogue and adds engine support for any number of player dialogue options.\n<br />\n<br />Mods can now create new dialogue experiences that emphasize player choice and have dialogue options that truly reflect their intent.\n<br />\n<br />XDI does not modify vanilla dialogue on its own but will display full-text for vanilla dialogue choices.\n<br />\n<br />Interestingly, in several vanilla scenes, Bethesda themselves have additional dialogue options recorded! In many cases, these are not wired up correctly for XDI (no associated responses, etc.) so they cannot simply be turned on globally. However, it is possible for modders to modify such vanilla dialogue scenes to wire them up correctly and expose additional voiced dialogue lines that are already part of the base game.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f6b26b][font=Courier New][size=5][b]★ Features ★[/b][/size][/font][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*] [b]Full dialogue text[/b]. View your dialogue options with full certainty of what you're going to say.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*] [b]Dialogue cues[/b]. A question icon can be optionally displayed for dialogue options that do not advance the conversation. No more accidentally making a choice  when all you wanted was to get more information. Options that end the conversation will have a door icon displayed beside them.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*] [b]Flexible dialogue options[/b]. Modders: have less than four things to say? Have just two options, Or add as many options as you'd like.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*] [b]No player voice, no problem[/b]. Skyrim and New Vegas didn't have a voiced player either! XDI makes engine modifications to overcome this. For unvoiced player dialogue, NPC dialogue starts right after option selection. The dialogue camera is hot-patched to keep focus on the NPC instead of (in vanilla) looking at the player's unmoving mouth. No more awkward pauses.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*] [b]Configurable via MCM[/b]. XDI comes with a MCM menu for easy configuration.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*] [b]No hacks[/b].

The result is: They use a larger variety of weapons.\n<br />\n<br />At level 1, raiders use level 1 weapons. But while the player character levels up, the weaponry of the raiders starts being more varied.\n<br />\n<br />Also, the raiders health is increased a bit when the player levels up.\n<br />\n<br />Raider: Vanilla level 1 (health 30) &gt;&gt;&gt; Modded level 1-10 (health 30-75)\n<br />Raider Scum: Vanilla level 4 (health 45) &gt;&gt;&gt; Modded level 5-15 (health 45-75)\n<br />Raider Psycho: Vanilla level 9 (health 70) &gt;&gt;&gt; Modded level 10-20 (health 70-120)\n<br />Raider Scavver: Vanilla level 14 (health 125) &gt;&gt;&gt; Modded level 15-25 (health 125-175)\n<br />Raider Waster: Vanilla level 21 (health 175) &gt;&gt;&gt; Modded level 25-35 (health 175-225)\n<br />Raider bosses[b]*[/b]: Vanilla level 10 (health 85) &gt;&gt;&gt; Modded level 25-35 (health 85-135)\n<br />Raider Survivalist and Raider Veteran: No modfied (they have levels 30 and 39 in vanilla)\n<br />\n<br />[b]*[/b][size=1](\"Raider bosses\" includes unique named raiders, but unique raiders have their own bonuses, and this is not modified by this mod.)[/size]\n<br />\n<br />As you can see, raiders will have a bit higher health value, but only when the player character has a higher level.\n<br />\n<br />In vanilla, basic raiders have pipe weapons and double barrel shotguns (and melee weapons). With this mod, basic raiders also can have 10mm pistols and hunting rifles, but only when the player character has a higher level. Other types of raiders get [b][u]larger[/u][/b] variety of weapons.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][b]Compatbility[/b][/size]\n<br />\n<br />This mod makes raiders have higher level weapons from the \"raiders weapons list\", but this mod doesn't modify this list. It is compatible with mods that modify weapons and leveled lists, but it may be not compatible with mods that modify raiders characters stats.\n<br />\n<br />This mod is fully compatible with Varied Raiders.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3]Miscellaneous things[/size]\n<br />[/b]\n<br />If you install this mod mid game, I recommend to wait more than 20 days in a inner cell (all respawnable things will be respawned).\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[font=Georgia][size=4][i]Would you like to know more?\n<br />[/i][/size][/font]\n<br />In a modded playthrough, with weapons added lo leveled lists, a higher levels means: Raiders will use many different weapons, specially at high levels.

This mod adds the Cybernetics Lab Workbench, and several pieces of armor (and a pair of RoboHand-gloves), each with a significant amount of customization including vanilla lining mods, special Gadget mods, advanced Frame mods, cybernetic implants, firmware upgrades, and 20+ paint/pattern options. The main pieces have light/medium/heavy variations, and the 'RoboHand' gloves can be modded to be exclusive to either the left/right hand. Most items are worn as armor and generally will fit with vanilla outfits (RoboGloves cant be worn with some vanilla 'gloved' outfits)\n<br />\n<br />A note on Bodyscales:\n<br />The vanilla game uses a funky system to scale over-armor to fit cleanly over under-clothing, this system works alright for the relatively small armors of the vanilla game, but for the Cyber armatures it can be a little aggressive. You might notice while wearing certain under-clothes (army fatigues) you will get massive scaling on Cyber Armatures. There's no way to avoid this without editing vanilla items. My best advice is to stick to thin under-clothes like Vault suits, harnesses, and BoS uniforms. Additionally you can scale down your characters weight to average/skinny to offset most strange scaling. The first-person models Have been specially made to not clip over the pipboy at any size. You will need another mod if you wish to hide the \n<br />pipboy in 3rd person, this mod will not do that for you.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />CBBE Bodyslide files are included for female versions, these may help with clipping, but are not necessary.\n<br />\n<br />Screenshot auto-approve is turned on, I'm sure most of you can take better screenshots than my potato computer can!\n<br />\n<br />There is a Palette guide in the screenshots that can help you find the color you want.\n<br />\n<br />[img]http://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/8609-0-1454997180.jpg[/img]\n<br />\n<br />[center]™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™[/center]\n<br />[img]http://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/8609-1-1453151432.jpg[/img]\n<br />\n<br />[img]http://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/8609-0-1453155310.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />All of the main items of this mod are made at the Cyber Crafting Bench. Once made they can be customized at an armor bench, paint/palette swaps cost nothing, some of the more advanced mods and armors have long parts lists, so remember to scroll the component list!\n<br

Marine armor left arm\n<br />Reshaped the Marine armor 1st person mesh to fit the pipboy better\n<br />\n<br />[size=5]v1.06b\n<br />[/size]fixed a missing Palette Texture\n<br />\n<br />[size=5]v1.06a[/size]\n<br />[b]Added a new Palette version[/b]: v4 Vibrant\n<br />-These colors are generally brighter than the other palettes, but not all are, one example is pictured above.\n<br />[b]Added Marine armor[/b]\n<br />-Better stats than top end Combat armor, Marine armor is the new top tier medium armor for Cybernetics.\n<br />-Note that this tier requires Far Harbor assets to display correctly, the stats will still work but the meshes will not display correctly.\n<br />[b]Rebuilt the male arm meshes[/b]\n<br />-Much less bulky\n<br />-Still looks best with an 'average' body type with the in-game slider, though high muscle builds can still work without excessive scaling\n<br />-Some outfits (ie: army fatigues) still have strange scaling, this is a vanilla issue\n<br />Reworked some component costs of Armor mods\n<br />-Most notably removed the need for Ballistic Fiber when crafting Raider Style armors\n<br />Fixed some object mod descriptions\n<br />Big nerf to Antimicrobial Cleanser\n<br />-This was hilariously overpowered in Survival\n<br />-Heals rads at about .3 rads persecond down from 3 rads per second\n<br />-Still retains its usefulness, but the heal is much more passive and gives radaway some value back\n<br />Removed the tiny 1 extra value/armor/energy resist/weight from palette mods\n<br />\n<br />[size=5]v1.05a[/size]\n<br />[size=3][b]REMOVED the need for AWKCR and Cosmetic Framework[/b][/size]\n<br />--The mod is 100% standalone now, no other mods or masters needed.\n<br />[size=3][b]ADDED T-51 heavy tier armor[/b][/size]\n<br />--makes full use of all palette colors\n<br />--unpainted allows you to use the classic coloration with a green chest and steel arms/legs\n<br />ADDED jump height leg gadget\n<br />--roughly doubles your jump height\n<br />ADDED Auto-medic Torso Gadget\n<br />--Unlike the PA version, the Auto-Medic still plays the stimpack animation\n<br />ADDED more stat bonus psudo-legendary mods\n<br />--Also reworked the recipe costs of the original Uni mods\n<br />--Generally each stat requires a large investment of a specific material, and a handful of nuclear material\n<br />--These are still interchangeable, and can be moved between armatures\n<br />--The Upper-Lower Connector also had a slot added for UniFrame mods, to make up for only having one for both legs\n<br />ADDED Inventory and ground models for most items\n<br />REWORKED most crafting recipes\n<br />--Lists should be MUCH shorter\n<br />--Rather than small amounts of lots of different things, most items now require a moderate amount of a few different things\n<br />REWORKED the Cyberlab\n<br />--With the keyword cap issue resolved the workbench can return without bloating keyword usage\n<br />--All armatures and extras (Belt/hands) are crafted at the new (old) workbench now\n<br />--The workbench can also be used to craft stuff from other CROSS mods that have been updated for it\n<br />--Not all CROSS mods are updated to use this yet, but its worth checking if you hate making cool stuff at the boring chemlab!\n<br />\n<br />[size=5]v1.03a[/size]\n<br />[b]Added the much requested feature to hide the chest straps on the arms.[/b]   \n<br />-This shows up like a new mod category in the mod menu for each arm\n<br />-by default on newly crafted armatures they are enabled\n<br />-on updating you should see an extra \"material\" category at the bottom of the the armor-mod list, this is where the toggle for the straps is.\n<br />All Torso meshes were updated to work with the Jetpack (and any other addons I might add down the line)\n<br />-They won't look any different, but trust me they are. \n<br />-If you've customized any torso meshes from this mod they likely won't work with the Jetpack mod without being tweaked.\n<br />\n<br />[size=5]v1.02a[/size]\n<br />[b]Added Raider armor mods[/b]\n<br />-Includes medium and heavy versions for arms/legs, and lite/med/heavy torso (lite has less garbage over the head)\n<br />-These use v1, v3, and vBoS palettes\n<br />-Polished/chrome versions can still be used, but they will not effect the raider armor, just the baseframe.\n<br />-Balance wise the raider versions are about the same as combat med/heavy, and slightly easier to make, with the major caveat of being extra heavy.\n<br />Cleaned up a few first person meshes that were still clipping occasionally\n<br />Moved Material swap records off of the Cosmetic Framework and back into the ESP for ease of updating.\n<br />[b]Combined exo-frame and Unibelt optional addons into Cybernetics[/b]\n<br />-You'll have to remake items from those addons, and Robohands may need to have color/texture reconfigured.\n<br />-you should disable those addons if you were previously running them, but other than losing the exo-frame/belt there shouldn't be any issue.\n<br />-If you don't disable those addons you will have duplicates in the AWKCR crafting menu, and existing items will likely be unmoddable.\n<br />\n<br />[size=5]v1.01b[/size]\n<br />Moved several shared components to a master file which further helps deal with the keyword cap.\n<br />-this also makes some of my other mods no longer dependent on this one.\n<br />Added a Chrome version of the BoS Palette, shiny!\n<br />More back end cleanup\n<br />\n<br />[size=5]v1.01[/size]\n<br />Added Light Combat Armor Arms\n<br />Dropped the unique crafting bench\n<br />-All wearables are crafted under CYBERTECH category of AWKCR armorsmith bench\n<br />-All mods are crafted at armor workbench\n<br />-Make sure to update exo-frame addon otherwise you will no longer be able to craft the exo-frames.\n<br />Re-added the unique crafting bench as an alternative armorbench\n<br />-functions exactly like a vanilla armor modding bench\n<br />Fixed a bad IsMoving comparison that was draining stamina incorrectly on movement based gadgets\n<br />Fixed Low Noise conversion's description to include the 10% movespeed while sneaking it has always provided.\n<br />Significant clean-up of torso/arm meshes\n<br />-Better rigging overall, less twisting metal parts\n<br />Minor adjustments to the v3 baseframe diffuse map\n<br />Included a \"NoRobotFootStepSounds\" esp file that removes the robotic noise when running/walking with leg armatures equipped (effects exo-legs as well) \n<br />\n<br />[size=5]v1.00[/size]\n<br />Added full legs\n<br />-Leg armatures are a single piece of armor for both legs, because it looks ridiculous to only wear one at a time\n<br />-armor values on are generally double their vanilla equivalent because obviously they are 2 armor slots in one\n<br />-natural +50 carryweight\n<br />-Robot footsteps!\n<br />-Full Palette/Index mod support\n<br />Added a lower torso item that works like the lower exo-legs to connect upper/lower frames\n<br />-uses the same slot as exo-legs, and can be palette/index modded\n<br />-Animates better for the cyber-legs than the exo-leg connector, though exo-legs provide the same functionality\n<br />Added Lite/Med/Heavy Combat armor upgrades for legs\n<br />Added t45 armor upgrade for legs\n<br />-Connect to upper frame via a secondary torso armature, or with exo frame to negate mobility penalty\n<br />Reduced mod category keywords for general keyword cap compatibility\n<br />Removed the 'friendly-names' of palette index mods\n<br />-these were never very accurate, read the area below the description for a more accurate description of color placements.\n<br />\n<br />[size=6][size=5]v.094[/size][/size]\n<br />Enabled the 'full-support' system\n<br />-full-support is provided by wearing linked leg armatures as well as either (or both) a linked exo-arm frame, or the Pre-war Cybernetics Torso.\n<br />Enabled two new arm gadgets that require full support. (Currently you will need the exo-frame addon to use legs mods, until full pre-war cybernetic legs are finished)\n<br />-Grounded Stabilizer -Eliminates all scope sway, and reduces bullet spread by 20% while crouched and not moving. Requires connected spine and leg supports.\n<br />-High Impact Reinforcement -Sprinting into enemies can stagger them. Requires connected spine and leg supports, as well as secondary gadget on arm/legs.\n<br />Enabled new unique mods for leg armatures. (currently requires exo-frame addon)\n<br />-Load bearing 1, 2, and 3, - provides 25, 50, and 100 carryweight.\n<br />-HighSpeed Servos - Movespeed increased by 10%. VATS Melee distance increased by 100%.\n<br />-Pneumatic Upgrade - Negates 80% of fall damge, and increases Swim Speed by 15%.\n<br />-Move assist Actuators - Reduced Sprint cost by 50%\n<br />-Low Noise Conversion - Sneaking is 40% quieter, but drains 4 AP per sec while moving.\n<br />-High Impact - Sprinting into enemies can stagger them. Requires connected spine and leg supports, as well as secondary gadget on arm/legs.\n<br />Power Armor modded armatures now have a mobility reduction mechanic for each piece equipped.\n<br />-this mobility penalty can be negated by wearing a full frame (Connected legs as well as a torso support item).\n<br />Improved on the Robo hand meshes for male and female.\n<br />-better overall shape.\n<br />-No more bulky wristwrap.\n<br />Updated Combat armor torso texture.\n<br />Added a BoS themed Palette\n<br />Altered how Palette Indexes are described, which should give a better idea of the colors they apply and where they are applied.\n<br />\n<br />[size=5]v0.93[/size]\n<br />ADDED palette v3. This is a further cleaned up texture/palette. v1 and v2 are still available.\n<br />Finished the t-45 PowerPlated Chest, which now has (the good parts of) a proper t45 torso.\n<br />-the Included bodyslide files for the t45 chest have 'size limits' so as to keep their overall shape up to a decent size.\n<br />Power Armor modded armatures have had their armor value increased significantly.\n<br />MOVED Synth hands into the regular PA hands\n<br />-Synth versions are now variations of the original hands (similar to how you switch between left/right/both).\n<br />Implemented Dynamic Naming for weight/style/Palette Index.\n<br />-You will probably have to rebuild armatures if updating from previous versions to get dynamic naming working.\n<br />Altered the 'winterized' palette index\n<br />-this was basically a third 'white' option and didnt look as good as the other two.\n<br />-while on the v2/3 palette this is nowa vibrant purple-yellow\n<br />-unchanged on palette v1\n<br />Significant file clean-up and reduced keyword usage\n<br />-All armature mods now ride on vanilla keywords now.\n<br />-This has the added bonus of making the mod menu list more ordered.\n<br />Removed the belt from Combat armor variations of the Torso armor\n<br />Fixed an issue with hands showing through gloves when using other mods that split up the hand meshes.\n<br />Fixed a filepath issue with high specular synth hand textures.\n<br />Altered the stats on base armors/mods to bring them more in line with similar vanilla armors.\n<br />Added some behind the scenes stuff to set up for legs.\n<br />\n<br />[size=5]v0.92[/size]\n<br />Added medium and lite Combat armor torso mods\n<br />Added medium combat armor arm mod.\n<br />Added a poison resistance spine implant.\n<br />Added two new \"entry level\" firmware mods\n<br />-LockBumper, while equipped all novice locks are impossible to fail. Easier to make than the other lockpick firmware.\n<br />-Trajectory Calculator, enables the throwing arc on grenades/Molotovs while equipped.\n<br />Cleaned up some old paint jobs to make use of Palette mods on parts they normally would leave at default.\n<br />--IE you can now have the Red forearm paint and still change the color of armor over the top of the painted frame.\n<br />Added Palette version 2.1\n<br />--This is an updated frame texture, other textures still on v2. Includes a Chrome 2.1\n<br />Cleaned up some records in the RoboGloves reference. Might help with crashing some people seem to have.\n<br />Added Synth hands. \n<br />--These function exactly like the regular the PA Frame hands.\n<br />--Can be swapped between Both/Left/Right at an armor bench.\n<br />--Can use Palettes, or be left unpainted.\n<br />\n<br />[size=5]v0.91[/size]\n<br />Added Heavy Combat armor versions of the medium armor.\n<br />-These are a heavy weight alternative to the kelogg armor and can be crafted with armorer rank 3.\n<br />Marked the \"brace\" center size options as WIP. \n<br />-These still need the t-45 chest and some other kind of armor added to these. For now they retain stats as if they had proper armor.\n<br />Removed the extra workbench entry which should clean up the workshop bloat a bit.\n<br />Moved Paletted 'material' mods to a new Armor-mod class: Palette Index. \n<br />-This allows more universal color swapping across palette versions.\n<br />Added a second palette version, which can be swapped to like custom paint jobs.\n<br />Renamed palette colors slightly, generally the colors are the same across v1 and v2, but colors with color1/color2 are respective to v1/v2.\n<br />Renamed \"polished\" custom paint and added Chrome Paint.\n<br />-These are now based on Palette versions.\n<br />-Polished applies a brighter specular map than normal to v1.\n<br /> -Chrome applies a very bright specular map to v2.\n<br />-Because these work like palettes any palette index color can be polished/chromed.\n<br />Added an amateurish attempt at upping the resolution of the Frame/Gloves, only applies to v2 palette and v2 Chrome.\n<br />Paint and palette index changes are now free.\n<br />Fixed some 1st person clipping issues with specific guns.\n<br />\n<br />Added a second ESP for people having issues with the unique crafting station.\n<br />-This ESP makes all armatures and advanced mods craft-able at the CHEMLAB, they must still be APPLIED at the armor bench.\n<br />-If you are still having issues with crafting items with this debug-esp the issue is likely related to overall bloat from large amounts of mods.\n<br />[center]™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™™[/center]\n<br />[img]http://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/8609-3-1453151432.jpg[/img]\n<br />The base limb armatures are nearly free and buildable easily at early levels, with the torso piece being the first major upgrade. Vanilla-standard armor mods/Paint/Size-mods can be applied for standard progression. From there things get more complex, the more unique Firmware/Implant/gadget/frame mods are significantly more powerful than vanilla armor mods and require more than just Armorsmith and Science perks, as well as large investments of rare components.\n<br />\n<br />Many of the unique mods require more than just the basic crafting perks, for example the lockpicking auto-picker mod requires both locksmith1 and robotics-expert1. The general idea is that CyberArm mods support a more role-playing playstyle and reward you for branching out your perk tree instead of just taking the few perks that really matter.

                "description": "[size=4][center][b]Description[/b][/center][/size]\n<br />Explosion Knockdown changes the behaviors of ballistic explosions so they send their targets flying. Grenades can be used now to interrupt your foe movement, incapacitate them for a while, or just used to see how they helplessly go through the air while you do some target practice on them. As in version 1.3 and above, Explosion Knockdown features support for Canary Save File Monitor.\n<br />\n<br />[center][size=4][b]Features[/b][/size][/center]\n<br />To prevent silly situations like a cherry bomb throwing a behemoth all across the Commonwealth, I created three tiers of explosion forces:\n<br />\n<br />[b]Small explosions[/b] only knocks off [b]normal-sized NPC without power armor[/b]. They now provide a excellent tactical distraction against a group of foot soldiers.\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Frag Grenade/Mine, ...\n<br />[*]Oxygen Tanks, Small Cars, Turret Explosions, ...\n<br />[*]Gauss Impact Explosion\n<br />[*]Power Armor Explosive Vent\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[b]Medium explosions[/b] can also ragdoll [b]Power-Armored NPCs[/b], but not large enemies (Yao-Guais, Behemoths and such). Now those Brotherhood mooks will never dare to disturb you anymore while you chill out with your buddy Danse!\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Missile, Broadsider\n<br />[*]Large Vehicles, Vertibird Crash, ...\n<br />[*]Behemoth Slam and Stomp\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[b]Large explosions[/b] knock [b]all NPCs[/b] down, including those normally immune to staggering. Use these if you really need to loose that Deathclaw that is chasing you for the last ten minutes.\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*](Mini) Nukes, Nuka Grenades, Quantum Thirst Zapper\n<br />[*]Artillery and Homing Beacon (which uses the Fat Man Explosion)\n<br />[/list]\n<br />Energy explosives like Pulse and Plasma Grenades, but also the Molotov, aren't affected by Explosion Knockdown, since they don't seem to exert an excessive force on the victims (for me, at least).\n<br />\n<br />Optionally, you can enable knockdown for the player via MCM, and change whether wearing Power Armor should make the player immune to knockdowns. This is not recommended though since the camera forces to 3rd person on every knockdown, potentially causing problems like stuck camera (at least on my end). You can also turn off the knockdown effect anytime and adjust the knockdown chances of each tier (they're 100% by default).\n<br />\n<br />As in update 1.5, you can turn off friendly fire against non-hostiles (they will respond to your explosion though and turn hostile) and your companions in the MCM.\n<br />\n<br />Watch the videos to get an idea how the mod works in-game!\n<br />\n<br />[b][center][size=4]Compatibility[/size][/center]\n<br />[/b]Conflicts with mods that edits the same explosion records. Mod added explosions also need patching. The base plugin only covers vanilla explosions. Patches for the following mods are included in the FOMOD:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Better Explosion Redux\n<br />[*]Wasteland Imports\n<br />[*]Remote Explosives \n<br />[*]True Frags\n<br />[*]RPG-7V2\n<br />[*]M79 Grenade Launcher standalone\n<br />[/list][u]All plugins are marked as ESL. [/u]\n<br />\n<br />To patch custom explosions yourself, fill the object effect field with one of the knockdown enchantments (or add the knockdown magic effect to the existing enchantment) and fill the Placed Object field with one of the temporary xmarkers.\n<br />\n<br />[center][size=4][b]Known issues[/b][/size][/center]\n<br />None currently. Any bug reports and/or improvement suggestions are welcome! Just leave a note in the corresponding sections and I'll try to answer :)",

                "description": "Alright, I&#39;ve had to overhaul the description page due to the most recent update, which is a major overhaul.\r<br />\r<br />This mod now adds the following:\r<br />*All DLC Support for ammo machines and the ballistic weapon machine.\r<br />*A Chem machine.\r<br />*A &#34;Nuka-Loom&#34; machine.\r<br />*New Textures\r<br />*Tweaked ammo recipes from Manufacturing Extended.\r<br />*Armour machines allowing the construction of full armour sets.\r<br />\r<br />That&#39;s right. This mod builds upon the mod, Manufacturing Extended, by Kentington by adding and tweaking where he left off. Firstly, it&#39;s added the DLC ammo in to the base ammo machine, now called the Ballistic Ammo Machine. It has also added some new machines, the much requested Chem station, and the Energy Weapon ammo machine. As of right now, only the Ballistic ammo machine has its unique texture, but that is scheduled to change as the mod grows. It should also be noted while this builds upon Manufacturing Extended, it is [b]not [/b]required to use this mod. So if you&#39;re only after the DLC support, then this mod works just as well on its own.\r<br />\r<br />I have also played around with a few of the recipes that Kentington had provided when making the ammo because I felt they didn&#39;t fit. Such an example is replacing the copper in Plasma Cartridges to plastic, because they look more plastic than coppery.\r<br />\r<br />The chem machine at present only has base game chems, nothing from DLC. But it does allow the creation of Med-X, Rad-X and Buffout, recipes not in the base game. The Energy Weapon ammo machines does what it says on the box, and it now allows the creation of flares and fusion cores. All with balancing of course.\r<br />\r<br />Huge thanks to Cartman1975 to helping me figure out how to add recipes, as well as making me the new textures. As well as Kentington for making the original Manufacturing Extended mod.\r<br />\r<br />[center][/center][u][b][center]Recommended mods[/center][/b][/u][list]\r<br />[*][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/16810/?]Growable wild plants[/url] - Great for growing plants for the chem machine such as brain fungus and hubflower.\r<br />[*][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/15429/?]Manufacturing Extended[/url] - Goes without saying really.  This mod builds upon said mod, so I recommend it if you don&#39;t yet have it. Just ensure this mod is loaded over it however, as this mod fixes a few bugs that one had.\r<br />[*][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/14996/?]Worthwhile Eyebot Pods[/url] - Great for getting components for the manufacturing machines.

In third person, all you can do is crouch behind some rock or furniture, occasionally walk out, and hope enemy bullets don&#39;t hit you.\r<br />\r<br />This mod hopes to give you a true cover mechanic.\r<br />\r<br />Integrating third-person cover hasn&#39;t been a trivial task at all.

If you don&#39;t, then the mod was not installed correctly. See [url=http://wiki.tesnexus.com/index.php/Fallout_4_Mod_Installation]here[/url] for instructions on how to set up Fallout 4 for modding.\r<br />\r<br />You will receive Take Cover and Take Cover Config in the AID section of your inventory.\r<br />\r<br />At this point, the cover system is active. Sprint towards a wall with your weapon drawn to take cover.\r<br />\r<br />You can also hotkey the Take Cover activator to a quick-key in your favorites to quickly enter and exit cover at any point in time, or use [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/11664/]FO4 Hotkeys[/url] to bind it to any key on your keyboard or any extra mouse buttons you may have. I highly recommend binding Take Cover to Shift+Aim with FO4Hotkeys so that you have cover available at the touch of your mouse.\r<br />\r<br />Use Take Cover Config to configure various aspects of the cover system, including whether sprint-to-cover is turned on and whether cover-vaulting is enabled.[/font]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#f6b26b][font=Courier New][size=5][b]★ Notes ★[/b][/size][/font][/color]\r<br />[font=Lucida Sans Unicode]\r<br />[size=4]☢ [/size]It wasn&#39;t easy to do, but yes - it works great with VATS&#33; VATS traditionally roots you to the spot and gives you no movement control, but this mod lets you &#34;pop-out&#34; of cover even in VATS. After entering VATS, tap V (view-change key) to pop out of cover. You automatically re-enter cover when VATS ends&#33;\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]☢ [/size]Did you know that Fallout 4 has [url=https://imgur.com/a/EGwRQ]first-person cover[/url]?[/font]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[center][img]http://i.giphy.com/lC9tAjmxeytR6.gif[/img]\r<br />[font=Courier New][size=1](Vanilla VS Mod)[/size][/font][/center]\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />[color=#f6b26b][font=Courier New][size=5][b]★ Known Issues ★[/b][/size][/font][/color]\r<br />\r<br />[size=4]☢ [/size][font=Lucida Sans Unicode] Weapons switched while in cover using a favorites hotkey will be invisible.

It&#39;s off by default. If turned on, you will automatically enter third-person and go into cover when sprinting up against a wall in first-person.
